# Repository Todo List

## Version Transition to v1.1.0 (2025-06-26)

**VERSION_TRANSITION Workflow Steps**:
- [x] 1. Audit Log Analysis and Processing - Analyze v1.0.0 audit data and extract development patterns
- [x] 2. Knowledge Base Synchronization - Update docs/ files with v1.0.0 insights and architectural patterns  
- [ ] 3. Repository Maintenance and Cleanup - Remove stale information and validate documentation links
- [ ] 4. Strategic Analysis and Operational Reporting - Generate operational reports and component interaction analysis
- [ ] 5. User-Facing Reports and Knowledge Base Updates - Create executive summaries and workflow effectiveness guides
- [ ] 6. Get Started Documentation - Update onboarding based on actual development experience
- [ ] 7. Next Version Readiness Assessment - Validate v1.1.0 readiness and generate go/no-go assessment

**Post-Transition Planning Items**:
- [ ] Check correctness of claude-swift documentation against actual implementation
- [ ] Create instructions for populating project directories after deployment
- [ ] Create TEMPLATE_PUBLISH workflow
- [ ] Design and implement FIX_RELEASE workflow for v1.0.x maintenance

**Key Discovery**: claude-swift already implements battle-tested sidecar deployment pattern with dual-folder architecture.

**Critical Insight**: All files in /claude/project/ root are mandatory hooks - template correctly preserves only audit/ and todo.md structure.
