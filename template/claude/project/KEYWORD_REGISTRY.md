## Registry Inheritance

This project registry extends the base WoW registry located at `../wow/KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md`. All base workflow keywords are inherited and available in this project context.

## Usage Pattern

For project-specific workflows:
```markdown
**EPIC_KEYWORD** â†’ See [../wow/workflows/EPIC_FILENAME.md](../wow/workflows/EPIC_FILENAME.md)
```

For inherited WoW workflows, refer to the base registry at `../wow/KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md`.
