# Repository Todo List

## Current Topics for Discussion

### SE Data-Driven Architecture Design
- **Status**: ‚úÖ CONCEPTUAL PHASE COMPLETE  
- **Evolution**: Workflow SEs ‚Üí Trigger-based autonomous execution
- **Core Insight**: Data patterns drive execution, not orchestration commands
- **Next Phase**: Step-by-step data architecture design
- **Focus Areas**:
  - State representation patterns for trigger conditions
  - Safety control data structures (kill switches)
  - Intervention queue and response protocols
  - Trigger landscape design methodology
- **Foundation**: Pattern-driven autonomous execution with safety controls

### Apache NiFi Integration Investigation
- **Status**: üîç RESEARCH NEEDED
- **Context**: Explore NiFi for data pipeline automation and integration
- **Scope**: Local development setup and API interaction capabilities
- **Potential Applications**: Data flow automation, ETL processes, system integration
- **Next Steps**: Research installation requirements and development workflow integration

### Claude Installable Component Implementation
- **Status**: üö® CRITICAL - VERSION PLANNING DEPENDENCY
- **Context**: Claude operational system must become installable component with embedded SE
- **Requirements**: Independent versioning, multi-repository support, SE automation
- **Architecture**: Standalone repository + embedded SE + installation mechanism
- **Impact**: Determines next version planning priorities and technical decisions
- **Document**: `claude/operational-docs/claude-installable-component-requirement.md`
- **Next Steps**: Component extraction design, SE integration architecture, migration planning

### Dual Report Strategy Implementation
- **Status**: üìã PLANNING NEEDED
- **Context**: Reports need both operational (Claude component) and user-facing versions
- **Challenge**: Current reports in `/docs/reports/` serve user-facing purpose
- **Solution**: Create operational versions in `/claude/operational-docs/` while keeping user summaries in `/docs/reports/`
- **Next Steps**: Design dual-report template and identify which reports need operational counterparts
