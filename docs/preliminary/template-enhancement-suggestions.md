# Template Enhancement Suggestions

## Overview

This document captures enhancement suggestions for the claude-swift template system that should be considered for future implementation phases.

## 1. Standardized Project Information API

### Concept
Template documentation should reference standardized project information files using requirement directives (MUST, SHOULD, MAY) rather than containing project-specific content.

### Proposed Schema
**Standard Lookup Files (claude/project/ root):**
```
claude/project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context.md          # MUST - Project purpose, domain, objectives  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture.md     # SHOULD - Technical structure, key components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ priorities.md       # MAY - Current focus, urgent items
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conventions.md      # SHOULD - Coding standards, naming patterns  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ team.md            # MAY - Team structure, communication patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ environment.md     # SHOULD - Setup, tools, dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ glossary.md        # MAY - Domain terminology, abbreviations
```

### Template Reference Pattern
```markdown
## Project Context Required
MUST read `claude/project/context.md` for project objectives and domain knowledge
SHOULD read `claude/project/architecture.md` for technical context  
MAY read `claude/project/priorities.md` for current focus areas
```

### Benefits
- **Predictable Locations**: Claude always knows where to find project information
- **Requirement Clarity**: Clear understanding of essential vs optional information
- **Template Portability**: Complete separation of template and project content
- **Graceful Degradation**: Adaptive behavior based on available information

## 2. Missing Information Reporting Rules

### Concept
Template workflows should actively validate their information dependencies and guide users to complete missing project information.

### Proposed Rules

**For MUST Requirements:**
```markdown
RULE: If MUST-referenced file is missing, Claude MUST:
1. Stop workflow execution
2. Report specific missing requirement  
3. Guide user to create required information
4. Offer to help populate missing file
5. Resume workflow only after requirement fulfilled
```

**For SHOULD Requirements:**
```markdown
RULE: If SHOULD-referenced file is missing, Claude MUST:
1. Report missing optional information
2. Explain impact on workflow effectiveness
3. Offer to proceed with degraded capability
4. Suggest creating missing information for future sessions
```

**For MAY Requirements:**
```markdown
RULE: If MAY-referenced file is missing, Claude MAY:
1. Note missing enhancement opportunity
2. Continue workflow without degradation
3. Mention potential value of creating file
```

### Example Implementation
```
Claude: "Cannot execute git workflow - missing REQUIRED project context.
        Please create `claude/project/context.md` with:
        - Project objectives
        - Domain description  
        - Key priorities
        
        Would you like me to help create this file based on our discussion?"
```

### Benefits
- **Deployment Validation**: Ensures project information setup is complete
- **User Guidance**: Active help in completing missing requirements
- **Quality Assurance**: Prevents silent workflow degradation
- **Self-Documenting**: Users learn what information is needed

## 3. Health Check Workflow

### Concept
A dedicated workflow to validate template deployment integrity and project information completeness.

### Proposed Scope
**Template Validation:**
- Verify all template files are present and correctly structured
- Check workflow file integrity and syntax
- Validate tool script functionality
- Confirm audit system operational status

**Project Information Validation:**
- Check for required project information files
- Validate project information file completeness
- Report missing or incomplete project context
- Suggest improvements to project documentation

**System Integration Validation:**
- Test workflow execution capability
- Verify tool automation functionality
- Check audit logging system
- Validate template update mechanism

### Proposed Implementation
```markdown
**Health Check Workflow Trigger:**
- `health sesame` ‚Üí HEALTH_CHECK workflow
- Automatic execution after template deployment
- Regular health monitoring (weekly/monthly)
- Pre-session validation option
```

### Expected Outputs
```
Health Check Report:
‚úÖ Template Status: All workflows present and valid
‚úÖ Tool Status: All automation scripts functional  
‚ö†Ô∏è  Project Status: Missing optional architecture.md
‚ùå System Status: Audit logging format issues detected

Recommendations:
1. Create claude/project/architecture.md for better workflow context
2. Fix audit log format in session_2025-06-20.log
3. Update git workflow configuration for current repository
```

### Benefits
- **Deployment Confidence**: Validate successful template deployment
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Identify problems before they impact work
- **System Maintenance**: Regular validation of operational integrity
- **User Education**: Help users understand system requirements

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- ‚úÖ Template structure creation
- ‚úÖ Basic deployment procedures
- ‚è≥ Template cleanup and deployment testing

### Phase 2: Information API (Next)
- üìã Implement standardized project information schema
- üìã Add missing information reporting rules to templates
- üìã Update template documentation with requirement directives
- üìã Test information API with sample projects

### Phase 3: Health Check System (Future)
- üìã Design health check workflow
- üìã Implement template validation routines
- üìã Create project information validation
- üìã Add system integration testing
- üìã Integrate with regular operational workflows

## Documentation Requirements

**For Information API:**
- Update template cleanup procedures with information schema
- Create project information file templates
- Document requirement directive standards
- Add missing information handling workflows

**For Health Check System:**
- Design health check workflow specification
- Create validation criteria and procedures
- Document health check reporting format
- Integrate with existing workflow system

## Success Criteria

**Information API Success:**
- Templates contain zero project-specific content
- All project information accessed through standard files
- Missing information gracefully handled with user guidance
- Consistent behavior across all template deployments

**Health Check Success:**
- Automated validation of template deployment integrity
- Proactive detection of system issues
- Clear reporting of status and recommendations
- Regular validation maintains system health
