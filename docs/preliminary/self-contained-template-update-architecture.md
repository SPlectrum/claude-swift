# Self-Contained Template Update Architecture

## Core Design Principle

The claude-swift template system uses Claude AI itself as the intelligent merge agent for template updates, creating a completely self-contained and self-managing update mechanism.

## Architecture Overview

### The Recursive Elegance
Since both the template repository and target project repositories run Claude with Ways of Working (WoW), the template can document its own merge procedures and Claude can execute them autonomously.

**Key Insight**: The template teaches Claude how to deploy and maintain itself.

### Update Workflow

1. **User Initiates Update**
   ```
   User: "update claude template from claude-swift"
   ```

2. **Claude Executes Intelligent Merge**
   - Fetches claude-swift template repository
   - Reads merge procedures from template's documentation
   - Analyzes local vs template differences
   - Executes intelligent merge preserving local operational data
   - Reports changes made vs preserved

3. **Self-Validating Process**
   - Claude understands semantic difference between template and operational content
   - Validates merge integrity
   - Provides clear summary of updates
   - Can rollback if issues detected

## No External Dependencies

### What We DON'T Need:
- ❌ Complex deployment scripts
- ❌ External merge tooling
- ❌ Package managers
- ❌ Installation wizards
- ❌ Update services

### What We DO Have:
- ✅ Self-documenting merge procedures
- ✅ Claude's contextual understanding
- ✅ Intelligent conflict resolution
- ✅ Automated validation
- ✅ Clear change reporting

## Repository Structure Implications

### Template Repository (claude-swift)
```
/template/                           # Clean template content
  /workflows/                        # Template workflow definitions
  /tools/                           # Template automation scripts
  /audit/                           # Template audit structure
  /operational-docs/                # Template documentation
/docs/                              # Template system documentation
  /template-merge-procedures.md     # Claude merge instructions
  /deployment-guide.md              # Initial setup guide
/claude/                            # Development operational data
```

### Target Project Repository (after deployment)
```
/claude/                            # Local operational instance
  /workflows/                       # Deployed + customized workflows
  /tools/                          # Deployed + local tools
  /audit/                          # Local audit logs (preserved)
  /operational-docs/               # Local docs (preserved)
```

## Intelligent Merge Categories

### Template Content (Can Be Overwritten)
- Base workflow definitions
- Standard tool scripts
- Documentation templates
- Default configurations

### Local Operational Data (Must Be Preserved)
- Audit logs and session history
- Project-specific todos and notes
- Customized workflow parameters
- Local tool configurations

### Customized Template Content (Needs Careful Handling)
- Modified workflow definitions
- Extended tool functionality
- Project-specific documentation
- Custom operational procedures

## Self-Evolution Capability

The system can evolve its own update mechanisms:
- Template merge procedures improve over time
- New merge categories can be defined
- Update workflows can be enhanced
- Error handling can be refined

All improvements are automatically available to existing deployments through the self-contained update process.

## Benefits

### For Users
- Simple natural language updates
- No technical installation complexity
- Intelligent conflict resolution
- Clear visibility into changes

### For Template Maintainers
- No deployment infrastructure to maintain
- Self-documenting update procedures
- Automatic distribution of improvements
- Built-in validation and rollback

### For the Ecosystem
- Consistent ways of working across projects
- Evolutionary template improvements
- Minimal operational overhead
- Self-managing distributed system

## Future Extensions

This architecture enables:
- Multiple template variants (claude-enterprise, claude-research)
- Selective update capabilities (workflows only, tools only)
- Template branching and merging strategies
- Cross-template learning and improvement sharing

## Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Create template structure and basic merge procedures
2. **Phase 2**: Implement intelligent merge logic documentation
3. **Phase 3**: Test with multiple target repositories
4. **Phase 4**: Refine procedures based on real-world usage
5. **Phase 5**: Enable template variant creation through cloning
