# Event-Driven Reminder System

## Overview

The claude-swift template system will leverage SPlectrum's event-driven choreography to create intelligent, automatic reminder systems that maintain operational discipline without manual oversight. This transforms maintenance from manual overhead to automatic system behavior.

## Integration with Event-Driven Architecture

### Background Claude SE Orchestration
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Claude SE instances monitor system state and timestamps
- **Automatic Triggering**: Events fire workflows based on actual conditions, not arbitrary schedules
- **Intelligent Intervention**: Claude provides contextual intelligence at decision points
- **Self-Maintaining System**: Operations maintain themselves through event choreography

### Event-State Monitoring Pattern
```
System State → Event Condition → Workflow Trigger → Claude Intervention → Action
```

**Example Flow:**
```
Health Report Age: 35 days → age > 30_days → HEALTH_CHECK → Claude validates → Report generated
```

## Reminder Categories and Trigger Patterns

### 1. Time-Based Maintenance Reminders

**Health and Validation:**
```
Event: health_report_age > 30_days → HEALTH_CHECK workflow
Event: audit_log_cleanup_age > 90_days → ARCHIVE_LOGS workflow
Event: template_update_check_age > 14_days → CHECK_TEMPLATE_UPDATES workflow
```

**Development Discipline:**
```
Event: last_backup_age > 7_days → BACKUP_REMINDER workflow
Event: dependency_check_age > 30_days → UPDATE_DEPENDENCIES workflow
Event: documentation_review_age > 90_days → REVIEW_DOCS workflow
Event: security_scan_age > 60_days → SECURITY_AUDIT workflow
```

**Learning and Improvement:**
```
Event: retrospective_age > 30_days → PROCESS_RETROSPECTIVE workflow
Event: metrics_analysis_age > 14_days → ANALYZE_METRICS workflow
Event: knowledge_base_update_age > 60_days → UPDATE_KNOWLEDGE workflow
```

### 2. Activity-Based Reminders

**Code Quality Maintenance:**
```
Event: commits_since_last_test > 10 → RUN_TESTS_REMINDER workflow
Event: code_coverage_drop > 5% → IMPROVE_COVERAGE workflow
Event: technical_debt_accumulation > threshold → REFACTOR_REMINDER workflow
```

**Project Management:**
```
Event: issues_open > threshold → TRIAGE_REMINDER workflow
Event: branch_age > 14_days → MERGE_OR_CLOSE_REMINDER workflow
Event: pr_review_pending > 3_days → REVIEW_REMINDER workflow
Event: milestone_progress < expected → SPRINT_ADJUSTMENT workflow
```

**Communication and Collaboration:**
```
Event: team_sync_age > 7_days → STANDUP_REMINDER workflow
Event: stakeholder_update_age > 14_days → STATUS_REPORT workflow
Event: customer_feedback_pending > response_sla → RESPONSE_REMINDER workflow
```

### 3. Context-Aware Intelligent Reminders

**Deadline and Priority Management:**
```
Event: approaching_deadline AND incomplete_tasks → PRIORITY_REMINDER workflow
Event: critical_bug_age > 24_hours → ESCALATION_REMINDER workflow
Event: release_approaching AND incomplete_features → SCOPE_REVIEW workflow
```

**Team and Resource Management:**
```
Event: new_team_member AND missing_onboarding → SETUP_REMINDER workflow
Event: team_member_overloaded AND available_resources → REBALANCE_REMINDER workflow
Event: knowledge_gap_detected AND expert_available → KNOWLEDGE_TRANSFER workflow
```

**Quality and Compliance:**
```
Event: production_deployment AND missing_docs → DOCUMENTATION_REMINDER workflow
Event: security_vulnerability_detected → PATCH_REMINDER workflow
Event: compliance_deadline_approaching → AUDIT_PREPARATION workflow
```

### 4. Learning and Adaptation Reminders

**Process Improvement:**
```
Event: repeated_pattern_detected → AUTOMATION_OPPORTUNITY workflow
Event: workflow_efficiency_degraded → PROCESS_IMPROVEMENT_REMINDER workflow
Event: error_frequency_increased → INVESTIGATION_REMINDER workflow
Event: bottleneck_identified → OPTIMIZATION_REMINDER workflow
```

**Knowledge Management:**
```
Event: same_question_asked > 3_times → CREATE_DOCUMENTATION workflow
Event: solution_reused > 5_times → TEMPLATE_CREATION workflow
Event: expertise_gap_detected → TRAINING_REMINDER workflow
```

**System Evolution:**
```
Event: new_best_practice_available → ADOPTION_REMINDER workflow
Event: tool_upgrade_available → EVALUATION_REMINDER workflow
Event: workflow_obsolescence_detected → MODERNIZATION_REMINDER workflow
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Event State Tracking
**System State Files:**
```
claude/project/system-state/
├── health-report.json          # Health check timestamps and status
├── maintenance-tracker.json    # Maintenance activity timestamps
├── activity-metrics.json       # Development activity counters
├── deadline-tracker.json       # Project timeline and milestone data
└── learning-metrics.json       # Process improvement tracking
```

**Example State File (health-report.json):**
```json
{
  "last_health_check": "2025-06-24T20:23:25Z",
  "health_status": "healthy",
  "template_version": "1.2.3",
  "next_check_due": "2025-07-24T20:23:25Z",
  "automated_checks_enabled": true,
  "check_frequency_days": 30
}
```

### Event Condition Evaluation
**Trigger Logic Examples:**
```javascript
// Time-based condition
const healthReportAge = now() - lastHealthCheck;
if (healthReportAge > 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000) {
  triggerWorkflow('HEALTH_CHECK', { age: healthReportAge });
}

// Activity-based condition  
const commitsSinceTest = getCommitCount() - lastTestRun.commitCount;
if (commitsSinceTest > 10) {
  triggerWorkflow('RUN_TESTS_REMINDER', { commits: commitsSinceTest });
}

// Context-aware condition
const isDeadlineApproaching = (deadline - now()) < 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
const hasIncompleteTasks = getOpenTasks().length > 0;
if (isDeadlineApproaching && hasIncompleteTasks) {
  triggerWorkflow('PRIORITY_REMINDER', { 
    deadline: deadline, 
    openTasks: getOpenTasks() 
  });
}
```

### Claude Intervention Points
**Intelligent Decision Making:**
```
Event Triggered → Claude Evaluates Context → Determines Action
```

**Example Claude Intervention:**
```
Event: commits_since_last_test > 10
Claude Analysis:
- Recent commits contain critical changes? → High priority test run
- Recent commits are documentation only? → Lower priority reminder
- Test suite currently broken? → Fix tests first workflow
- CI/CD pipeline handles testing? → Verify pipeline status

Claude Decision: Appropriate workflow path and urgency level
```
