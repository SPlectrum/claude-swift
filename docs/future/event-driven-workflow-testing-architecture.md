# Event-Driven Workflow Testing Architecture

## Overview

The claude-swift template system will evolve to support Test-Driven Development (TDD) through SPlectrum's event-driven choreography architecture. This approach transforms workflows from manual AI orchestration to automated event-driven state machines with strategic Claude intervention points.

## Current vs Future Architecture

### Current Approach: Manual Orchestration
```
User Request → Claude Analyzes → Claude Executes → Claude Reports
                     ↓
            Full Manual Workflow Management
```
**Limitations**: 
- Difficult to test systematically
- Non-deterministic execution paths  
- Hard to measure reliability
- Manual process variations

### Future Approach: Event-Driven Choreography
```
Test Data → Event Triggers → Workflow State Machine → Measured Outcomes
                                    ↓
                    Claude Intervention Points
                    (Happy Path / Exception Path)
```
**Advantages**:
- Reproducible execution sequences
- Deterministic workflow paths
- Measurable success criteria
- Automated validation capabilities

## Event-Driven Workflow Design

### Core Principles

**1. Workflow Inversion**
- Workflows become event-driven state machines
- Claude intervenes at specific decision points rather than orchestrating entire flows
- Rigid execution framework with flexible AI decision-making

**2. Strategic AI Intervention**
- **Happy Path Interventions**: Standard workflow decisions requiring context
- **Exception Path Interventions**: Error handling and recovery decisions
- **Validation Interventions**: Quality checks and verification steps

**3. Choreography vs Orchestration**
- Events trigger workflow state transitions
- Each state knows its next possible states
- Claude provides intelligence at transition decision points

### Event-Driven Workflow Structure

```
Workflow Definition:
├── States (workflow steps)
├── Events (triggers for state transitions)  
├── Transitions (valid state changes)
├── Claude Intervention Points
│   ├── Decision Points (which transition to take)
│   ├── Validation Points (verify state completion)
│   └── Exception Handlers (error recovery)
└── Success/Failure Criteria
```

## Testing Architecture

### Test Environment Setup

**Model Repositories**:
- Clean template deployments for testing
- Isolated environments per test scenario
- Reproducible initial states

**Test Scenarios**:
- Standardized input data sets
- Known event sequences
- Expected outcome definitions

### Testing Process Flow

**1. Test Scenario Execution**
```
Test Repository Setup → Apply Test Data → Trigger Events → Execute Workflow
                                                                ↓
                                                    Measure Outcomes
```

**2. Claude Intervention Testing**
```
Workflow Reaches Decision Point → Claude Analyzes Context → Makes Decision
                                                                ↓
                                                    Validate Decision Quality
```

**3. Reliability Measurement**
```
Multiple Test Runs → Success/Failure Rates → Performance Metrics → Robustness Analysis
```

### Testable Metrics

**Workflow Reliability**:
- Completion rates across scenarios
- Error handling effectiveness  
- Recovery success rates
- Performance consistency

**Claude Intervention Quality**:
- Decision accuracy at intervention points
- Context understanding effectiveness
- Exception handling appropriateness
- Learning and improvement over time

**System Robustness**:
- Behavior under edge cases
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Data integrity maintenance
- Operational continuity
