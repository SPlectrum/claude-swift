# Just-in-Time Workflow Design

**Created**: 2025-07-08  
**Purpose**: Design adaptive workflow system that minimizes cognitive overhead while preserving governance benefits

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem
Current workflow system optimizes for **governance and accountability** but creates **cognitive overhead** that reduces working effectiveness. Users (especially Claude) experience:

- Excessive mandatory rule compliance
- Rigid ceremonial processes 
- Dual todo system confusion
- Constant audit logging interruption
- Over-specified branch management

### The Solution: Adaptive Workflow Layers
**Activate workflow depth only when the situation demands it** - start minimal, scale complexity as needed.

## Workflow Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Natural Work (Default State)
**Philosophy**: Let work flow naturally with minimal ceremony

**Active Elements**:
- Simplified audit logging (auto-triggered)
- Basic git commits when logical
- Single todo system (repo todo list only)
- File path specification (proven valuable)

**Audit Pattern**:
```
TIMESTAMP|CONTEXT|OUTCOME
2025-07-08T16:20:00Z|feature_work|Added user authentication - completed todo item
2025-07-08T16:25:00Z|documentation|Updated API docs for auth endpoint
2025-07-08T16:30:00Z|testing|Added unit tests for login flow
```

**Characteristics**:
- ✅ Natural work rhythm preserved
- ✅ Essential tracking maintained  
- ✅ Minimal cognitive interruption
- ✅ Focus on outcomes, not process steps

### Layer 2: Situation-Triggered (Auto-Activation)
**Philosophy**: System intelligence detects when deeper protocols are needed

**Auto-Activation Triggers**:

1. **Conflict Detection** → Branch Management Protocol
   ```
   TRIGGER: Uncommitted changes + context switching
   ACTION: Guide through clean branch transition
   SCOPE: Single operation, return to Layer 1
   ```

2. **Template Sync Detection** → Synchronization Workflow
   ```
   TRIGGER: Modified files + template update available
   ACTION: Activate template synchronization protocols
   SCOPE: Until sync complete
   ```

3. **Multi-Session Work** → Session Boundary Management
   ```
   TRIGGER: Work spanning multiple sessions detected
   ACTION: Enhanced session start/end procedures
   SCOPE: Session boundaries only
   ```

4. **Quality Gate Requirements** → Validation Protocols
   ```
   TRIGGER: Pre-release work or user-specified quality needs
   ACTION: Activate comprehensive validation workflows
   SCOPE: Until quality gates satisfied
   ```

**Smart Context Detection**:
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for situation awareness
if (hasUncommittedChanges() && contextSwitching()) {
    activateWorkflow('BRANCH_MANAGEMENT');
}

if (auditLogShowsPatterns() && needsOptimization()) {
    suggestWorkflow('OPTIMIZATION_REVIEW');
}

if (filesModified() && templateUpdatePending()) {
    activateWorkflow('TEMPLATE_SYNC');
}
```

### Layer 3: User-Requested (Explicit Activation)
**Philosophy**: Full ceremonial workflows available on demand

**Explicit Triggers**:
- `planning sesame` → Complete planning workflow depth
- `release sesame` → Full release ceremony and quality gates
- `git sesame` → Comprehensive branch management protocol
- `quality sesame` → Deep validation and compliance checking

**Characteristics**:
- Full workflow complexity available when needed
- User controls activation timing
- Complete ceremony for critical operations
- Returns to appropriate layer after completion

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Workflow Router Enhancement
**Objective**: Build intelligent workflow activation system

**Components**:
1. **Context Detection Engine**
   - Git status analysis
   - File modification patterns
   - Session continuity tracking
   - Work pattern recognition

2. **Workflow Activation Logic**
   - Situation-to-workflow mapping
   - Activation thresholds
   - Scope management (when to deactivate)

3. **Progressive Disclosure Interface**
   - Start with minimal requirements
   - Add complexity only when needed
   - Clear indication of active workflow layer

### Phase 2: Smart Defaults Implementation
**Objective**: Optimize default behavior for natural work

**Changes**:
1. **Simplified Audit Logging**
   - Auto-triggered background process
   - Outcome-focused instead of step-by-step
   - Intelligent timestamping
   - Context-aware categorization

2. **Unified Todo System**
   - Repository todo list as single source
   - Built-in TodoWrite/Read for session work only
   - Automatic transfer on session boundaries

3. **Flexible Git Operations**
   - Logical commit boundaries
   - Reduced ceremonial overhead
   - Branch management only when conflicts exist

### Phase 3: Context Preservation
**Objective**: Remember and adapt to work patterns

**Features**:
1. **Workflow Memory**
   - Remember which layer current work requires
   - Adapt activation thresholds based on patterns
   - Learn from user workflow preferences

2. **Smart Transitions**
   - Seamless layer switching
   - Context preservation across transitions
   - Minimal disruption to work flow

## Specific Workflow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Normal Feature Development
**Default Layer 1 Behavior**:
```
1. Work on feature naturally
2. Auto-audit: "feature_work|Implemented user login validation"
3. Commit when logical: "Add login validation with error handling"
4. Update repo todo: Mark item completed, remove from list
5. Continue to next work item
```

**No Ceremonial Overhead**: No mandatory steps, workflow logging, or rigid protocols

### Scenario 2: Context Switch with Conflicts
**Auto-Activation Layer 2**:
```
1. System detects: uncommitted changes + different work context
2. Auto-message: "Uncommitted work detected, activating branch management"
3. Guide through: commit → push → PR → merge → switch
4. Auto-audit: "branch_transition|Clean transition from feature-auth to bugfix-validation"
5. Return to Layer 1 for continued work
```

**Smart Intervention**: Only when conflicts require resolution

### Scenario 3: Release Preparation
**User-Requested Layer 3**:
```
User: "release sesame"
1. Full ceremony activates
2. Comprehensive audit logging begins
3. Quality gates enforcement
4. Documentation validation
5. Complete release workflow
6. Return to Layer 1 after release
```

**Full Control**: User decides when comprehensive process is needed

### Scenario 4: Template Update
**Situation-Triggered Layer 2**:
```
1. System detects: template update + local modifications
2. Auto-message: "Template sync needed, activating synchronization workflow"
3. Guided template merge process
4. Conflict resolution assistance
5. Validation of sync completion
6. Return to Layer 1
```

**Intelligent Response**: Complexity activated only when template changes detected
