# Event-Driven Choreography Mode

**Status**: ðŸ”® Future Enhancement (Not Yet Implemented)

## Vision

Event-driven choreography will complement interactive orchestration by enabling autonomous task routing and workflow execution based on system events and quality gates.

## Planned Capabilities

### Autonomous Task Routing
- Automatic outbox collection on task creation
- Immediate distribution to target inboxes
- Event-based triggering without human intervention
- Parallel processing across projects

### Quality Gates
- Leverage Propose-Execute pattern for automation
- Configurable approval thresholds
- Risk-based human escalation
- Audit-driven learning

### Event Triggers
- Git push events
- Issue state changes
- Schedule-based operations
- Cross-project dependencies

### Choreography Patterns
- Saga pattern for multi-project transactions
- Compensation workflows for failures
- Event sourcing from audit logs
- Decentralized coordination

## Foundation from Interactive Mode

The interactive mode provides essential building blocks:

### Established Infrastructure
- Task routing system (inbox/outbox)
- Audit logging for all operations
- Workflow standardization
- Project registration framework

### Proven Patterns
- Propose â†’ Review â†’ Execute (becomes automated gates)
- Step-by-step execution (becomes event chain)
- Outcome-first optimization (drives automation decisions)
- Single-step completion (enables event granularity)

### Behavioral Learning
- Accumulated audit logs train automation
- Common patterns become templates
- Human decisions inform AI choices
- Context building enables smarter routing

## Integration Strategy

Event-driven mode will integrate seamlessly with interactive mode:

1. **Hybrid Operation**: Some workflows automated, others remain interactive
2. **Progressive Automation**: Start with low-risk operations
3. **Human Override**: Always maintain manual control option
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fall back to interactive when needed

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Event Infrastructure
- Event bus implementation
- Message queue integration
- Event store setup
- Monitoring framework

### Phase 2: Simple Automation
- Auto-distribute tasks on creation
- Scheduled inbox processing
- Basic event triggers
- Success/failure notifications

### Phase 3: Intelligent Choreography
- Pattern recognition from audit logs
- Risk-based routing decisions
- Cross-project dependency handling
- Self-healing workflows

### Phase 4: Advanced Patterns
- Distributed sagas
- Complex event processing
- Predictive task routing
- Autonomous optimization

## Benefits When Implemented

### Efficiency Gains
- 24/7 task processing
- Reduced coordination overhead
- Faster cross-project cycles
- Parallel execution paths

### Quality Improvements
- Consistent execution patterns
- Automated quality gates
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Reduced human error

### Scale Enablement
- Handle more projects
- Complex dependency chains
- High-volume task processing
- Enterprise-ready coordination

## Design Principles

### Event-First Architecture
- Everything is an event
- Immutable event log
- Event sourcing patterns
- CQRS where appropriate

### Loose Coupling
- Projects remain independent
- Async communication only
- No direct dependencies
- Graceful failure handling

### Human-Centric Automation
- Automate the mundane
- Escalate the exceptional
- Maintain transparency
- Enable intervention

## Preparation Today

While implementing interactive mode:
1. Follow consistent patterns
2. Create comprehensive audit logs
3. Use Propose-Execute pattern
4. Document decision rationale

These practices will enable smoother transition to event-driven choreography when implemented.
