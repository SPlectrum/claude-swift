# Using Claude-Swift Workflows Effectively

*Practical guidance for getting the most out of your daily workflows*

## Essential Daily Workflows

### Session Management
These are your most important workflows for staying organized:

**`start sesame`** - Begin your work session
- Use this every time you start working
- Sets up your workspace properly  
- Helps you pick up where you left off

**`finish sesame`** - End your work session
- Use this before stepping away
- Saves your progress properly
- Prepares clean handoff for next time

**Why it matters**: Consistent session management keeps your work organized and prevents lost progress.

### Git Operations
**`git sesame`** - Git workflow assistance
- Use when you need help with git operations
- Guides you through commits, branches, and merges
- Prevents common git mistakes

**When to use**: Any time you're unsure about git commands or need help organizing your changes.

## Project Management Workflows

### Task Organization
**`todo sesame`** - Manage your project todos
- Keep track of what needs to be done
- Organize tasks by priority
- Track progress over time

**`next sesame`** - Get your next task
- Find the most important thing to work on
- Helps when you're not sure what to do next
- Keeps you focused on priorities

### Planning Workflows
**`planning sesame`** - Switch between planned and unplanned work
- Organize your work approach
- Balance structured tasks with exploration
- Maintain clear project direction

**When to use**: When you need to decide between working on planned features vs. exploring new ideas.

## Development Workflows

### Documentation
**`docs sesame`** - Documentation assistance
- Help with creating and updating docs
- Organize your project documentation
- Keep information current and useful

**Best for**: When you need to document your work, create guides, or organize project information.

### Release Management
**`release sesame`** - Create project releases
- Guide you through the release process
- Organize release notes and versioning
- Ensure consistent release procedures

**When to use**: When you're ready to publish a new version of your project.

## Workflow Effectiveness Tips

### Start Small
- Begin with just session management workflows
- Add other workflows as you get comfortable
- Don't try to use every workflow immediately

### Build Habits
- Use `start sesame` and `finish sesame` every day
- Let other workflows become natural over time
- Focus on consistency over perfection

### Customize Your Approach
- Use workflows that fit your project type
- Adapt the frequency to your working style
- Skip workflows that don't add value for you

## Common Workflow Patterns

### The Daily Routine
1. `start sesame` - Begin your session
2. `todo sesame` - Check what needs to be done
3. Work on your tasks
4. `git sesame` - Commit your changes
5. `finish sesame` - End your session

### The Weekly Planning
1. `todo sesame` - Review your task list
2. `planning sesame` - Organize your approach
3. `next sesame` - Identify priorities
4. Focus on the most important work

### The Release Cycle
1. Complete your features
2. `docs sesame` - Update documentation
3. `release sesame` - Create the release
4. `todo sesame` - Plan next version

## Getting the Most Value

### Focus on Session Management
- These workflows provide the biggest benefit
- They work for any type of project
- They prevent common problems

### Use Git Workflows When Uncertain
- Don't struggle with git alone
- Let Claude guide you through complex operations
- Learn better git habits over time

### Keep Documentation Current
- Use docs workflows regularly
- Don't let documentation fall behind
- Make it part of your regular routine

## Troubleshooting Workflow Issues

### Workflow Not Working
- Make sure you're in the right directory
- Check that claude-swift is properly installed
- Verify your project structure is correct

### Can't Remember Commands
- Use `commands sesame` to see all available workflows
- Start with just a few workflows and add more gradually
- Focus on the patterns that work best for you

### Workflows Feel Overwhelming
- Start with just session management
- Add one new workflow at a time
- Focus on building consistent habits

## Success Indicators

You're using workflows effectively when:
- ✅ Your work sessions feel more organized
- ✅ You rarely lose track of what you were doing
- ✅ Git operations are smoother and less confusing
- ✅ Your documentation stays current
- ✅ You can easily prioritize your work
- ✅ Project releases are systematic and consistent

## Building Effective Collaboration

### Start with Core Workflows
- Begin with `start sesame` and `finish sesame` for session management
- Use `git sesame` when you need git assistance
- Let Claude handle the execution details while you make decisions

### Add Automation Gradually
- Try `todo sesame` to let Claude manage task organization
- Use `next sesame` when you want Claude to suggest priorities
- Allow workflows to take over routine collaboration patterns

### Enable Historical Context
- Use `docs sesame` to let Claude maintain documentation
- Let the audit log build project knowledge over time
- Allow Claude to reference historical context for better assistance

### Focus on Collaboration Value
- Use workflows that enable better human-AI teamwork
- Let Claude automate tasks that benefit from systematic execution
- Build patterns that leverage Claude's ability to handle routine work
