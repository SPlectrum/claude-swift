# Working Effectively with Claude

*Proven patterns for productive human-AI collaboration*

## Plan Before You Code

### Why It Works
When you think through your approach before diving into implementation, you and Claude can work much more efficiently together. Planning sessions help Claude understand your goals and suggest better solutions.

### How to Do It
1. **Start with the big picture**
   - What are you trying to achieve?
   - What are the main challenges?
   - What success looks like?

2. **Discuss the approach**
   - Ask Claude for different ways to solve the problem
   - Talk through pros and cons of each approach
   - Agree on the best path forward

3. **Break it into steps**
   - Divide the work into manageable pieces
   - Prioritize the most important parts first
   - Plan for testing and validation

4. **Execute systematically**
   - Work through one piece at a time
   - Test each piece before moving on
   - Adjust the plan as you learn

## Clear Communication Patterns

### Be Specific About What You Want
**Instead of**: "Make this better"
**Try**: "Improve error handling in the login function to show user-friendly messages"

### Provide Context
**Good**: "I'm building a web API for a small team. Performance isn't critical, but code clarity is important."
**Better**: "I'm building a web API for a small team. Performance isn't critical, but code clarity is important. My team prefers explicit error handling over exceptions."

### Ask for Alternatives
**Try**: "What are 3 different ways I could solve this problem?"
**Then**: "Which approach would be best for a team new to this technology?"

## Effective Work Sessions

### Start Each Session Clear
- Review what you accomplished last time
- Confirm what you want to work on today
- Ask Claude to summarize the current state if needed

### Use the "Sesame" System
- `start sesame` - Begin with clear goals
- `finish sesame` - End with proper handoff
- This keeps your work organized and trackable

### Make Decisions Together
- You decide **what** to build and **why**
- Claude suggests **how** to implement it
- You approve the approach before moving forward

## Common Collaboration Patterns

### The "Rubber Duck" Pattern
Explain your problem to Claude as if explaining to a colleague. Often the act of explaining helps you clarify your thinking, and Claude can spot issues you might miss.

### The "Code Review" Pattern
Have Claude review your code with specific questions:
- "What potential issues do you see?"
- "How could this be more maintainable?"
- "Are there security concerns I should address?"

### The "Teaching" Pattern
When learning something new, ask Claude to:
- Explain concepts step by step
- Provide examples in your specific context
- Quiz you on key concepts

## Managing Complexity

### Break Large Tasks Down
Instead of "Build a user authentication system", try:
1. "Design the user data model"
2. "Create the registration endpoint"
3. "Add password validation"
4. "Implement login flow"

### Use Iterations
- Get something basic working first
- Test it thoroughly
- Then add the next feature
- Repeat until complete

### Document as You Go
- Keep notes on decisions you make
- Record why you chose one approach over another
- Update your project documentation regularly

## When Things Go Wrong

### Debugging Together
- Share the full error message
- Describe what you expected vs. what happened
- Walk through the steps that led to the problem

### Learning from Mistakes
- Ask "What could we do differently next time?"
- Document solutions for future reference
- Update your approach based on what you learn

## Building Effective Collaboration

### Consistent Session Management
- Always start and end sessions cleanly so Claude can track context
- Let Claude handle documentation updates using audit log history
- Use workflows to automate routine organizational tasks
- Focus on strategic decisions while Claude handles execution

### Continuous Context Building
- Let the audit log accumulate project history for Claude to reference
- Use session workflows to build systematic project knowledge
- Allow Claude to maintain documentation based on logged activities
- Leverage historical context for better assistance over time

## Success Indicators

You're collaborating effectively when:
- ✅ Claude handles routine execution tasks while you focus on decisions
- ✅ Claude can reference project history to provide contextual assistance
- ✅ Documentation maintains itself using audit log information
- ✅ Workflows automate repetitive collaboration patterns
- ✅ The audit log builds rich context that improves support over time
