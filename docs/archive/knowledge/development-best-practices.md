# Best Practices for Claude-Swift Users

*Practical tips for getting the most out of your collaboration with Claude*

## Starting Your Work Sessions

### Begin with Clear Intent
- Use `start sesame` to let Claude handle session setup
- Let Claude review previous session context from audit log
- Focus on your strategic goals while Claude manages workspace details

### Let Claude Handle Setup
- Claude will verify git status and branch state
- Claude will access project documentation from historical context
- You focus on decisions while Claude handles execution details

## During Development

### Work in Small Steps
- Break large tasks into smaller pieces
- Complete one piece at a time
- Test each piece before moving on
- Celebrate small wins along the way

### Communicate Clearly
- Be specific about what you want
- Explain your constraints and preferences
- Ask for clarification when needed
- Give feedback on Claude's suggestions

### Keep Things Organized
- Update your documentation as you go
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep your workspace tidy
- Track your progress in notes

## Managing Your Project

### Documentation That Helps
- Keep a simple project overview
- Document your key decisions and why
- Maintain a list of known issues
- Update your setup instructions

### Version Control Habits
- Commit early and often
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep your branches organized
- Review changes before committing

### Planning and Priorities
- Maintain a backlog of tasks
- Prioritize the most important work
- Break large features into smaller parts
- Plan for testing and validation

## Collaboration Patterns

### Making Decisions Together
- You decide what needs to be done
- Claude suggests how to do it
- You approve the approach
- Work together on implementation

### When You're Stuck

- Share relevant context
- Ask for different approaches
- Try the simplest solution first

### Learning New Things
- Ask for explanations in your own words
- Request examples in your context
- Build understanding step by step
- Practice with small examples

## Quality Practices

### Code Quality
- Write code that your team can understand
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Testing Approach
- Test the happy path first
- Add error handling
- Test edge cases
- Document any known limitations

### Review Process
- Review your own work before asking for help
- Have Claude review your code
- Ask specific questions about quality
- Learn from the feedback

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### When Things Don't Work
- Read the error message carefully
- Check your recent changes
- Try the simplest fix first
- Ask for help with specific details

### Getting Unstuck
- Take a step back and explain the problem
- Ask for alternative approaches
- Try a different part of the task
- Come back to difficult problems later

### Maintaining Momentum
- Focus on progress, not perfection
- Solve problems incrementally
- Document what you learn
- Keep your goals realistic

## Building Effective Collaboration

### Consistent Session Management
- Always start and end sessions cleanly so Claude can track context
- Let Claude maintain documentation using audit log history
- Use workflows to automate routine review and planning tasks
- Focus on strategic decisions while Claude handles execution

### Continuous Context Building
- Let the audit log accumulate project knowledge for Claude to reference
- Use workflows to build systematic patterns Claude can follow
- Allow Claude to identify areas for improvement from historical data
- Enable Claude to suggest next steps based on project history

## Success Indicators

You're following good practices when:
- ✅ Claude handles routine execution while you focus on strategic decisions
- ✅ The audit log provides rich context for Claude to assist you
- ✅ Workflows automate organizational tasks that previously required manual effort
- ✅ Claude can reference project history to provide contextual support
- ✅ Documentation maintains itself using accumulated audit log information
- ✅ Collaboration patterns become systematic and repeatable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Planning Mistakes
- Don't skip the planning phase
- Don't try to do everything at once
- Don't ignore testing until the end
- Don't forget to update documentation

### Communication Issues
- Don't assume Claude knows your context
- Don't be vague about what you want
- Don't ignore Claude's questions
- Don't hesitate to ask for clarification

### Technical Problems
- Don't commit untested code
- Don't ignore error messages
- Don't skip proper git workflows
- Don't work directly on main branch
