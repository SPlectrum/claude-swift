# Development Best Practices

*Extracted from claude-swift v1.0.0 successful patterns*

## Session Management Excellence

### Operational Discipline (100% Compliance Achieved)
**SESSION_START Protocol**:
- Verify branch state (unplanned default)
- Check system time for accurate audit timestamps
- Initialize audit logging infrastructure
- Confirm MANDATORY rule compliance

**SESSION_END Protocol**:
- Archive session accomplishments
- Verify clean repository state
- Update persistent todo management
- Log completion with next steps

**Benefits Proven**:
- Complete audit trail for accountability
- Clean handoffs between sessions
- Consistent operational state management
- Systematic progress tracking

### Choice Point Architecture
**Pattern**: After every completed step, present options:
- Continue with related next step
- Switch to different priority item  
- Address urgent issues
- End session cleanly

**Success Metrics**:
- Prevents tunnel vision and scope creep
- Enables dynamic re-prioritization
- Provides natural stopping points
- Maintains user control over direction

## Architecture Development Best Practices

### Front-Loading Strategy (64% Efficiency Gain)
**Proven Approach**:
1. **Comprehensive Problem Analysis**: Document all requirements and constraints
2. **Solution Design Documentation**: Create detailed architectural blueprints
3. **Prototype Validation**: Test core concepts before full implementation
4. **Breakthrough Execution**: Concentrated implementation using prepared foundation

**Quality Indicators**:
- 95%+ workflow completion rate when architecture is prepared
- Minimal rework cycles (2-3 corrections maximum)
- High stakeholder satisfaction with outcomes
- Successful real-world deployment validation

### Component Interaction Management
**Dependency Cascade Pattern**:
CLAUDE.md → README.md → Implementation Files

**Integration Strategy**:
- Central configuration drives all other changes
- Documentation updates reflect implementation state
- Template system maintains deployment readiness
- Audit trail tracks all component relationships

## Template System Best Practices

### Sidecar Deployment Excellence
**Dual-Folder Pattern Success**:
- `claude/wow/`: Ways of Working framework (shared)
- `claude/project/`: Project-specific configuration (customized)
- Clean separation prevents contamination
- Template system remains deployable

**Project Hook Architecture**:
- Generic workflows with project-specific hooks
- Configuration management without framework modification
- Template purity maintained through placeholder system
- Deployment validation ensures quality

### Synchronization Recipe (Production Validated)
```bash
# 1. Archive current state (safety net)
mkdir -p template/archive && mv template/* template/archive/

# 2. Blind copy current repository state
cp -r claude/ template/ && cp CLAUDE.md template/

# 3. Reset project files to generic template format
# (Compare against template/archive/ for reference)

# 4. Remove project-specific contamination
# (Version reports, audit archives, project workflows)

# 5. Validate template purity and deployability
```

**Benefits**:
- Simple, reliable, foolproof execution
- Complete synchronization without missed files
- Template maintains deployment readiness
- Archive provides rollback capability

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Compliance Automation Targets
**Current Manual Processes** (Automation Candidates):
- File reference validation (broken link detection)
- Documentation back-link verification
- Template purity checking
- Workflow completion validation

**Quality Gate Integration**:
- Pre-commit validation hooks
- Template deployment readiness checking
- Documentation compliance verification
- Audit log format validation

### Process Effectiveness Measurement
**Key Metrics to Track**:
- Workflow completion rate (target: 95%+)
- Session management compliance (target: 100%)
- First-attempt deployment success (target: 90%+)
- Documentation effort ratio (target: <25%)

## Collaboration Optimization

### Human-AI Interface Best Practices
**Strategic Control Points**:
- Architecture decisions and quality gates
- Process optimization and efficiency improvements
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- User experience and workflow design

**AI Execution Excellence**:
- Systematic implementation following patterns
- Comprehensive documentation maintenance
- Compliance checking and validation
- Pattern recognition and optimization suggestions

### Communication Efficiency
**"Sesame" Protocol Success**:
- Single-word approval for streamlined decisions
- Reduces communication overhead
- Maintains human control while enabling AI efficiency
- Creates clear approval audit trail

**Decision Point Management**:
- Present clear options at choice points
- Provide context for decision-making
- Enable easy direction changes
- Maintain progress visibility

## Workflow Development Excellence

### Router Pattern Success
**VERSION Workflow Router**: Centralizes version-related workflow dispatch
**DEPLOYMENT Workflow Router**: Manages scenario-specific deployment paths

**Benefits**:
- Clear workflow organization and discovery
- Consistent execution patterns
- Easy maintenance and enhancement
- Scalable pattern for new workflow types

### Sub-Workflow Architecture
**TEMPLATE_SYNCHRONIZATION**: Shared recipe for multiple parent workflows
**PROJECT_*_PROCESS**: Hook pattern for project-specific customization

**Design Principles**:
- Reusable components reduce duplication
- Clear separation of concerns
- Project customization without framework modification
- Consistent execution patterns across workflows

## Performance Optimization Insights

### Documentation Efficiency (30% Effort Reduction Target)
**Automation Opportunities**:
- Reference documentation generation
- Link validation and updates
- Template compliance checking
- Audit report generation

**Human Focus Areas**:
- Strategic architecture documentation
- Process design and optimization
- User experience and workflow design
- Quality gate definition

### Development Speed Enhancement (30% Target Increase)
**Pattern Reuse Strategy**:
- Proven architectural patterns as templates
- Workflow router expansion for common scenarios
- Sub-workflow library for shared functionality
- Configuration management automation

**Efficiency Multipliers**:
- Architecture-first breakthrough sessions
