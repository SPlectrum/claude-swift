# Roadmap - Future Operational Designs

This directory contains design exploration documents for future Claude-Swift system evolution.

## Design Documents

### CLAUDE_COLLABORATIVE.md
Explores a balanced approach between automation and human collaboration:
- Streamlined workflows with human checkpoints
- "Show don't tell" methodology
- Light planning with collaborative decision points

### CLAUDE_OPTIMIZED.md  
Explores minimal overhead operational patterns:
- Only 5 essential workflows
- "Work first, document when necessary" approach
- Removes ceremonial processes

### CLAUDE_DUAL_MODE.md
Explores event-driven architecture vision:
- Single pathway execution with batch logging
- Designed for both interactive and automated modes
- Foundation for future automation capabilities

### CLAUDE_COLLABORATIVE_DEBUGGING.md
Explores debugging capabilities in dual-mode system:
- Same logic runs in production (automated) and debug (collaborative) modes
- Step-through execution and state inspection
- Progressive disclosure levels

## Purpose

These documents represent **design alternatives** and **architectural visions** being considered for future system evolution. They are not current operational instructions - the active behavioral guidance is in the root `CLAUDE.md` file.

## Status

These are **roadmap items** for potential implementation, exploring different approaches to:
- Automation vs. collaboration balance
- Workflow efficiency optimization  
- Event-driven system architecture
- Debugging and system understanding capabilities
