# Workflow Simplification - Architectural Decisions Record

## Overview
This document records the major architectural decisions made during the systematic simplification of Claude workflow files, completed in July 2025.

## Decision Context
The Claude workflow system had grown complex with:
- Workflows containing extensive inline bash and Python implementation
- Inconsistent patterns between orchestration and implementation
- Over-engineered validation and "MANDATORY" governance language
- Complex caching logic causing sync issues
- Documentation scattered across operational and reference locations

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Workflow Orchestration vs Implementation Separation

**Decision**: Convert all workflows from containing inline implementation to clean orchestrators that delegate to scripts.

**Rationale**:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Workflows define "what" to do, scripts define "how" to do it
- **Maintainability**: Script logic can be updated without touching workflow files
- **Consistency**: Established clear pattern across all workflows
- **Reusability**: Scripts can be used by multiple workflows or called independently

**Implementation Pattern**:
```bash
# Before: Inline bash/Python in workflow
# Complex implementation mixed with orchestration

# After: Clean delegation
claude/wow/scripts/audit-log "WORKFLOW" "workflow_start" "operation" "" "Starting workflow"
claude/wow/scripts/workflow-specific-script
claude/wow/scripts/audit-log "WORKFLOW" "workflow_complete" "operation" "" "Workflow completed"
```

**Impact**: 
- Reduced workflow files from hundreds of lines to dozens
- Eliminated duplicate implementation across workflows
- Created consistent execution pattern

### 2. Script Consolidation and Standardization

**Decision**: Consolidate all automation scripts in `claude/wow/scripts/` with Node.js and shebang execution.

**Rationale**:
- **Single Location**: All executable scripts in one directory
- **Consistent Runtime**: Node.js with `#!/usr/bin/env node` shebang
- **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage existing GitHub API scripts (`gh-issue`, `gh-api`)
- **Tool Specification**: Mandatory tool specification directive in CLAUDE.md

**Migration**: Moved scripts from `claude/wow/automation/` to `claude/wow/scripts/` and updated shebangs.

**Benefits**:
- Simplified execution model
- Reduced runtime dependencies
- Consistent script interface

### 3. Issue Management Phase Approach

**Decision**: Implement GitHub-only issue management first, design proper caching later.

**Problem**: Complex caching/sync logic was causing issues and blocking workflow simplification.

**Phase 1 Solution** (Implemented):
- Simple GitHub API-based scripts using existing `gh-issue` and `gh-api`
- Basic JSON caching without complex gap detection or sync logic
- Working issue management immediately available

**Phase 2 Plan** (Future):
- Design proper local caching architecture
- Update script implementations to use new caching
- Keep workflows unchanged (they just call scripts)

**Benefits**:
- Immediate working issue management
- Avoided complex caching problems
- Clean foundation for future enhancement

### 4. Epic and Project Management Removal

**Decision**: Remove all epic and GitHub project management references from workflows.

**Scope**: 
- Removed 40+ epic references from NEW_VERSION_PLANNING.md
- Removed 15+ GitHub project management references
- Replaced with feature-based and milestone-based planning

**Rationale**:
- **Simplification**: Reduced complexity in version planning
- **Focus**: Milestone-based approach more straightforward
- **Maintenance**: Fewer moving parts to maintain

### 5. Natural Language Trigger Unification

**Decision**: Unify multiple technical triggers into single natural language interfaces.

**Examples**:
- `issue sesame` → handles CREATE_ISSUE, CLOSE_ISSUE, ISSUE_CACHE, NEXT_ISSUE
- `release sesame` → handles FULL_RELEASE → VERSION_TRANSITION → NEW_VERSION_PLANNING
- `task sesame` → unified TASK_CREATE for all repositories

**Benefits**:
- **User Experience**: Simpler, more intuitive triggers
- **Discoverability**: Easier to remember and use
- **Flexibility**: Backend workflows can change without affecting user interface

### 6. Template-Based Content Generation

**Decision**: Implement template-based approach for issue and task creation.

**Implementation**:
- `claude/wow/templates/issue-template.md` with `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` syntax
- `claude/wow/templates/task-template.md` for cross-repository tasks
- Scripts handle template loading and placeholder replacement

**Future Expansion**: Template selection based on natural language detection.

**Benefits**:
- **Consistency**: Standardized issue/task structure
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add specialized templates
- **Maintainability**: Template changes don't require script changes

### 7. Documentation Organization

**Decision**: Separate operational documentation from reference/analysis documentation.

**Structure**:
```
claude/wow/                           # Operational only
├── KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md              # Active keyword system
├── SCRIPT_REFERENCE.md              # Script usage reference  
├── TEMPLATE_REFERENCE.md            # Template system reference
├── config.md                        # System configuration
├── scripts/                         # Executable files only
├── templates/                       # Active templates
└── workflows/                       # Workflow orchestration

docs/claude-wow-cleanup/             # Archive/analysis
├── optimizations/                   # Design analysis
├── spl/                            # Project analysis  
├── wow-docs/                       # Strategy documents
└── *-REFERENCE.md                  # Implementation docs
```

**Rationale**:
- **Clarity**: Operational vs reference material clearly separated
- **Navigation**: Easier to find what you need for daily use
- **Maintenance**: Reduced cognitive load in operational directories

## Implementation Statistics

### Workflow Simplification Results:
- **CREATE_ISSUE.md**: 251 lines → 44 lines (83% reduction)
- **ISSUE_CACHE.md**: 536 lines → 38 lines (93% reduction)  
- **NEXT_ISSUE.md**: 217 lines → 42 lines (81% reduction)
- **NEW_VERSION_PLANNING.md**: 245 lines → 69 lines (72% reduction)

### Script Creation:
- **4 new issue management scripts**: clean GitHub-only implementation
- **6 coordination scripts**: patch-release-process, version-transition-process, etc.
- **Template system**: 2 templates with expansion framework

### Documentation Movement:
- **Moved to docs**: 15+ analysis/reference files
- **Kept operational**: 4 reference files at appropriate levels
- **Created**: TEMPLATE_REFERENCE.md for complete reference system

## Success Criteria Met

1. ✅ **Consistent Pattern**: All workflows follow orchestration → script delegation
2. ✅ **Working Implementation**: Issue management functional with GitHub-only approach  
3. ✅ **Clean Structure**: Operational directories contain only operational files
