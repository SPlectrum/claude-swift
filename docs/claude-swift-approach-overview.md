# Claude-Swift Approach Overview

## Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the claude-swift development approach, architectural principles, and collaborative methodologies that have emerged through systematic human-AI partnership.

## Core Philosophy

### Human-AI Collaborative Development
Claude-swift is developed using a **strategic-tactical partnership model**:
- **Humans provide strategic direction** - What to build, why to build it, architectural decisions
- **AI provides tactical execution** - How to implement, detailed work, consistency maintenance  
- **Dialogue governs all significant changes** - Discussion before execution prevents unilateral decisions

### Operational Optimization
All documentation and workflows are **optimized for AI execution** while remaining human-readable:
- Single authoritative sources prevent interpretation conflicts
- Clear precedence hierarchies eliminate ambiguity
- Structured governance rules enable reliable automated execution
- Procedural workflows focus on implementation without rule duplication

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Sidecar Deployment Pattern
```
parent-directory/
├── target-project/              # User's actual project
│   ├── claude/project/         # Project docs (tracked)
│   └── claude/wow/             # WoW machinery (tracked for operational risk mitigation)
└── claude-swift/               # Template repo (sidecar)
```

**Benefits:**
- **Zero confusion** - Only one active WoW system per project
- **Clean separation** - Project content stays separate from operational machinery
- **Upgrade safety** - Template updates don't conflict with project documentation

### 2. Dual-Folder Architecture
**claude/project/ (Tracked):**
- Project requirements and architecture documentation
- Team agreements and coding standards  
- Project-specific configuration and planning
- Business context and domain knowledge
- **Mandatory hooks**: Essential project configuration files (project-info.md, version-config.md, KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md)

**claude/wow/ (Tracked for Operational Risk Mitigation):**
- Operational workflows and automation scripts
- Audit logs and session history
- Ways of working machinery and tools
- **WoW system configuration**: Template architecture settings (config.md)
- **Base workflow library**: Reusable workflows for any project

### 3. Template System Design
**Generic WoW Templates:**
- Completely portable operational workflows
- No project-specific content or hardcoded values
- Universal governance rules and procedures
- Reusable across any target project

**Project Configuration Hooks:**
- Project-specific data in claude/project/ root for visibility
- Template variables for customization ({PROJECT_NAME}, {ARTIFACT_NAME})
- Clean separation between generic workflows and project identity
- **Hook system discovery**: Extensible project customization within standard WoW framework
- **Release process hooks**: PROJECT_RELEASE_PROCESS for project-specific pre-release steps

## Governance Architecture

### Rule Precedence Hierarchy
```
OPERATIONAL_RULES.md (Universal Governance - TRUMPS ALL)
├── Collaboration rules (human-AI partnership governance)
├── Universal methodology (single-step completion, discussion patterns)
├── File and path management (exact specifications, repo protocols)
├── Audit and documentation (format enforcement, tracking requirements)
├── Version control (branch policies, transition protocols)
└── Documentation standards (location rules, organization patterns)

Workflow Files (Tactical Execution)
├── Implementation procedures without rule duplication
├── Automation commands and technical steps
├── Reference OPERATIONAL_RULES for governance authority
└── Focus on "how" rather than "what" or "why"
```

### Foundational Collaboration Rules
**MANDATORY OPERATIONAL OPTIMIZATION**: Claude MUST optimize operational documentation for collaborative execution patterns where users provide strategic direction and Claude executes tactical implementation.

**MANDATORY COLLABORATIVE DECISION-MAKING**: All significant workflow changes, architecture decisions, and operational modifications MUST be discussed through dialogue before execution.

## Workflow Consolidation Pattern

### Single Entry Point Routers
Instead of multiple confusing triggers, claude-swift uses intelligent workflow routers:

**DEPLOYMENT Workflow (`deploy sesame`):**
- Detects: Fresh project, legacy /claude/ structure, existing dual-folder
- Presents: Contextual options based on environment analysis
- Routes: To specialized sub-workflows (FRESH_DEPLOYMENT, MIGRATION_DEPLOYMENT)

**VERSION Workflow (`version sesame`):**
- Detects: Version state, milestone completion, release readiness
- Presents: Planning, transition, release, or status options
- Routes: To VERSION_PLANNING, VERSION_TRANSITION, RELEASE_PROCESS sub-workflows

### Benefits of Router Pattern
- **Reduced cognitive load** - Single trigger instead of multiple confusing options
- **Context-aware guidance** - System detects appropriate actions automatically
- **Better user experience** - No guessing which command to use
- **Extensible architecture** - Easy to add new scenarios as sub-workflows

## Content Organization Standards

### README.md Organization (claude-swift rule)
README.md contents MUST reflect:
1. **docs/ folder contents FIRST** - Deployment guides, architecture, research
2. **claude/ folder contents SECOND** - Operational workflows of interest to users

### Documentation Hierarchy
```
docs/                           # All user-facing documentation
├── deployment/                 # Deployment and installation guides
├── preliminary/                # Architecture and design documents  
├── research/                   # Analysis and competitive research
└── processes/                  # Development and operational processes

claude/project/                 # Project-specific configuration
├── version-config.md          # Version strategy and build configuration
├── project-info.md            # Project identity and boundaries
├── todo.md                    # Cross-session continuity
├── docs/                      # Project planning documentation
├── workflows/                 # Project-specific workflows
└── audit/                     # Development audit trails

claude/wow/                    # Ways of working machinery
├── workflows/                 # Operational workflow definitions
├── docs/                      # Development strategy documents
└── automation/                # Automation scripts and helpers
```

## Development Methodology

### Single-Step Completion Pattern
- Each step is a complete, meaningful achievement
- Mark step as DONE immediately upon completion  
- NO automatic progression to "next step" of same task
- Present choice points after every completed step

### Collaborative Decision Pattern
1. **Analysis and Options** - AI analyzes situation and presents strategic options
2. **Discussion** - Human and AI discuss approaches, implications, trade-offs
3. **Decision** - Human makes strategic decision on direction
4. **Execution** - AI executes tactical implementation following governance rules
5. **Validation** - Results reviewed and next steps determined collaboratively

### Magic Word Protocol
**"Sesame!"** = Universal agreement + go-ahead signal
- Fits established `{action} sesame` workflow pattern
- Clear intent for AI to proceed with discussed approach
- Eliminates confirmation overhead while maintaining collaborative control

## Quality Assurance

### Template Contamination Prevention
- **Generic templates only** - No project-specific content in WoW workflows
- **Project hooks system** - Configuration separated from operational procedures  
- **Validation processes** - Systematic checking for hardcoded project references
- **Clean separation** - Project identity vs operational machinery

### Rule Conflict Prevention
- **Single authoritative source** - OPERATIONAL_RULES trumps all specific workflows
- **No rule duplication** - Workflows focus on procedures, not governance
- **Clear precedence** - Hierarchical rule structure prevents interpretation conflicts
- **Consistent references** - All workflows reference governance authority explicitly

### Audit Trail Maintenance
- **Comprehensive logging** - All significant activities tracked in audit system
- **Structured format** - `TIMESTAMP|WORKFLOW|STEP_TYPE|CONTEXT|FILE_PATH|DESCRIPTION`
- **Session continuity** - Cross-session todo management and progress tracking
- **Historical preservation** - Complete development history maintained

## Success Criteria

### Deployability
- Clean deployment to any target project without modification
- Zero mixing of template machinery with project content  
- Automatic detection and appropriate handling of different project scenarios

### Usability  
- Clear workflow triggers and intelligent guidance for users
- Context-aware option presentation based on project state
- Minimal cognitive overhead for adopting teams

### Maintainability

- **Enhanced project detection** - More sophisticated analysis of target environments  
- **Workflow recommendation engine** - AI-driven suggestions for appropriate workflows
- **Template variants** - Specialized templates for different project types

### Scalability Considerations
- **Team collaboration** - Multi-user workflows and coordination patterns
- **Enterprise deployment** - Organization-wide template distribution and updates
- **Integration points** - APIs and hooks for external tool integration
- **Performance optimization** - Efficient handling of large-scale deployments

## Conclusion

Claude-swift represents a systematic approach to human-AI collaborative development that prioritizes:
- **Clear governance** over ad-hoc decisions
- **Collaborative control** over unilateral automation  
- **Template portability** over project-specific solutions
- **Operational efficiency** over traditional documentation patterns

This approach has proven effective for maintaining strategic human control while leveraging AI capabilities for consistent, high-quality tactical execution. The architecture scales from individual projects to organization-wide adoption while preserving the core principles of clean separation, collaborative governance, and systematic quality assurance.
