# Claude-Swift

*Advanced collaborative AI workflows for comprehensive project management*

## What is Claude-Swift?

Claude-swift transforms Claude Code into an intelligent project management partner that handles strategic planning, execution coordination, and continuous optimization. This isn't just task automation - it's a complete collaborative AI system that learns from your project history to provide increasingly sophisticated assistance.

### **Collaborative AI Capabilities:**
- **Intelligent Work Prioritization** - Claude analyzes dependencies, effort, and impact to recommend optimal task sequences
- **Strategic Project Planning** - Version roadmaps, epic organization, and milestone management with AI-driven insights
- **Context-Aware Decision Support** - Recommendations based on your project's development patterns and historical data
- **Automated Process Optimization** - Continuous improvement through audit log analysis and pattern recognition

### **Comprehensive Project Management:**
- **Full Version Lifecycle** - Planning → Development → Release → Analysis → Next Version
- **Smart Issue Management** - Dependency tracking, effort estimation, and priority scoring
- **Documentation Automation** - Context-aware documentation generation and maintenance
- **Strategic Analysis** - Extract insights from development data for process improvement

## Why Use Claude-Swift?

- `start sesame` → Session initialization
- `finish sesame` → Session completion  
- `git sesame` → Git workflow
- `github sesame` → GitHub workflow
- `todo sesame` → Repository todo management
- `version sesame` → Version management orchestrator (detects state and presents options)
- `planning sesame` → Planned vs unplanned work
- `next sesame` → Next issue selection
- `docs sesame` → Documentation workflow

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Template system implementation
- ✅ Architecture design complete
- ✅ Deployment guides created  
- 🔄 Deployment scripts in development
- 🔄 Testing and validation pending

## Contributing

This template system follows strict operational discipline:
- All changes logged in audit system
- Repository todo list managed via REPO_TODO_WORKFLOW
- Phase-based development with clear milestones
- Comprehensive testing before deployment

## Support

For template usage and workflow questions:
1. Check documentation in docs/ directory
2. Review workflow guides in claude/wow/workflows/
3. Use workflow triggers (start sesame, docs sesame, etc.)
4. Review audit logs for troubleshooting
