# Single-Path Execution Optimization

## Current Problems
- Multiple conditional paths in workflows (if cached/not cached, if committed/uncommitted)
- Different execution flows for same operation
- Makes automation unpredictable

## Target State
```bash
# Before: Multiple paths
if [ condition ]; then
    path_a
else
    path_b
fi

# After: Single deterministic path
ensure_precondition
execute_operation
emit_event
```

## Implementation Examples

### COMMIT Workflow
```bash
# Current: Conditional issue closure
if issue_in_cache; then
    update_cache; close_github
else
    close_github; wait_for_sync
fi

# Optimized: Single path
validate_issue_exists_in_cache || exit
update_cache
close_github
emit_event "issue_closed"
```

### SESSION_START
```bash
# Current: Complex uncommitted work handling
if uncommitted_work; then
    if significant; then
        run_session_end
    else
        stash_changes
    fi
fi

# Optimized: Single path
check_work_state
commit_if_needed  # Deterministic based on state
emit_event "session_ready"
```

## Benefits
- Predictable execution for automation
- Easier to test and debug
- Clear event emission points
- Supports both interactive and automated modes
