# COMMIT Workflow

## Overview
Intelligent commit workflow that stages changes, creates descriptive commit messages, and automatically closes GitHub issues if work resolves them.

## Trigger
**User-Friendly**: `commit sesame`
**Technical**: `COMMIT`
**SESSION_END Integration**: Automatically called during SESSION_END step 3

## Purpose
- Stage all current changes for commit
- Generate intelligent commit message based on changes and context
- Detect if work resolves any GitHub issues
- Commit changes with proper attribution
- Push to main branch
- Close resolved issues automatically

## Dual Context Support
- **Manual Usage**: `commit sesame` for mid-session commits
- **SESSION_END Integration**: Automatic execution during session closure with session-aware messaging

## Prerequisites
- Clean working directory or meaningful changes
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) configured for issue management
- Current work represents a logical commit unit

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initialize Audit Logging
```bash
# Load Node.js audit functions
source claude/wow/scripts/audit-functions.sh

# Start workflow with explicit logging
audit_log "COMMIT" "workflow_start" "commit_sesame" "" "Initiated COMMIT workflow for session work completion"
```

### 2. Audit Log Validation
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "audit_validation" "" "Verifying recent work has corresponding audit entries"
```

**Actions:**
1. Check `claude/project/audit/current/current.log` for recent entries
2. Verify work items have corresponding `item_complete` entries
3. Check for incomplete workflow logging patterns
4. Validate audit log follows proper format and completion patterns
5. Warn if recent work appears undocumented in audit log

**Audit Validation Patterns:**
- **Recent file changes** should have corresponding audit entries
- **Completed work items** should have `item_complete` logging
- **Workflow activities** should be properly documented
- **File creation** should have `file_created` entries

**Validation Outcomes:**
- ‚úÖ **Pass**: Recent work properly documented, proceed with commit
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Some work may be undocumented, suggest adding audit entries
- ‚ùå **Block**: Critical work undocumented, require audit completion before commit

### 3. Change Assessment
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "change_assessment" "" "Analyzing current changes and git status"
```

**Actions:**
1. Run `git status` to identify changed files
2. Run `git diff --stat` to see scope of changes
3. Check for untracked files that should be included
4. Validate changes represent a logical commit unit

### 4. Issue Detection
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "issue_detection" "" "Scanning changes and context for resolved issues"
```

**Actions:**
1. Check recent audit log entries for issue references
2. Search commit message context for issue numbers (#62)
3. Analyze changed files against open GitHub issues
4. Identify issues that this work resolves

### 5. Commit Message Generation
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "message_generation" "" "Generating descriptive commit message"
```

**Format varies by context:**

**Manual Commit (`commit sesame`):**
```

- Reference to methodology or approach used

[Context: Why this change was needed]

### 6. Commit Execution
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "commit_execution" "" "Staging, committing, and pushing changes"
```

**Actions:**
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with generated message
git commit -m "Generated commit message"

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Log successful commit
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "commit_execution" "" "Staged all changes, committed as $(git rev-parse --short HEAD), pushed to main successfully"
```

### 7. Issue Closure
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "issue_closure" "" "Closing resolved GitHub issues"
```

**Actions:**
1. For each detected resolved issue:
   ```bash
   gh issue close #62 -c "Resolved in commit: [commit-hash]"
   ```
2. Add comment explaining resolution
3. **Cache-first closure**: Update cache first, then sync to GitHub
   ```bash
   # Only close issues that exist in cache (cache-first rule)
   python3 -c "
   import json
   with open('claude/project/cache/issues.json', 'r') as f:
       cache = json.load(f)
   del cache['123']
   with open('claude/project/cache/issues.json', 'w') as f:
       json.dump(cache, f, indent=2)
   print('‚úì Removed issue #62 from cache')
   "
   gh issue close #62 -c "Resolved in commit: [commit-hash]"
   ```
4. Log issue closure in audit log
   ```bash
   audit_log "COMMIT" "step" "issue_closure" "$issue_number" "Closed issue #$issue_number via commit resolution"
   ```

### 8. Workflow Completion
```bash
audit_log "COMMIT" "workflow_complete" "commit_sesame" "" "COMMIT workflow completed successfully - changes committed and issues resolved"
```

## Interactive Prompts

### Issue Resolution Confirmation
When potential issue resolution is detected:
```
Detected potential issue resolution:
- Issue #62: "Remove references to old ways of doing across all workflows"
- Changes: Modified auth.js, added error handling

Does this commit resolve issue #62? (yes/no):
```

### Commit Message Review
```
Generated commit message:
---
Fix authentication flow bug

- Updated token validation logic
- Added proper error handling for expired tokens
- Improved user feedback for auth failures

Context: Resolves intermittent login failures reported by users
Closes #62

## Smart Detection Patterns

### Issue Reference Detection
- **Audit log scanning**: Look for recent `#62` references
- **File change analysis**: Match changed files to issue descriptions
- **Commit context**: Analyze work done against open issues
- **User confirmation**: Always confirm before closing issues

### Commit Message Intelligence
- **Change scope**: Single file vs multiple files
- **Change type**: feat/fix/docs/refactor based on changes
- **Implementation details**: Extract key changes from diffs
- **Context preservation**: Include why change was needed

## Error Handling

### No Changes Detected
```
No changes detected for commit.
Run 'git status' to verify current state.
```

### Merge Conflicts
```
Merge conflicts detected. Resolve conflicts before committing:
git status  # See conflicted files
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .   # Stage resolved files
`commit sesame`  # Retry commit
```

### Push Failures
```
Push failed. Syncing with remote:
git pull origin main --rebase
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main
```

## Integration Points

### SESSION_END Integration
- **Automatic Execution**: COMMIT workflow is automatically called during SESSION_END step 3
- **Session-Aware Messaging**: Generates session summary commits instead of generic messages
- **Complete Closure**: Ensures all session work is committed and issues are properly closed
- **Zero Manual Effort**: Issue tracking happens automatically at session end

### Issue Workflow Integration
- Detects when work resolves GitHub issues
- Provides clean closure with commit references
- Maintains issue tracking accuracy

### Audit Logging Integration
- All commit operations logged in audit trail
- Issue closures recorded for accountability
- Commit hashes preserved for reference

## Success Criteria
- All changes staged and committed successfully
- Descriptive commit message generated
- Resolved issues automatically closed
- Changes pushed to main branch
- Audit trail complete

## Usage Examples

### Simple Commit
```
`commit sesame`
# Result: Analyzes changes, generates message, commits and pushes
```

### With Issue Resolution
```
# After working on issue #62
`commit sesame`
# Result: Commits changes and closes issue #62 automatically
```

### Multiple Issues
```
# After fixing bugs #62 and #63
`commit sesame`
# Result: Commits changes and closes both issues with references
```

## Benefits
- **Eliminates manual commit composition**
- **Ensures consistent commit format**
- **Automatically manages issue lifecycle**
- **Provides intelligent change detection**
- **Maintains clean git history**
- **Integrates with existing workflows**
