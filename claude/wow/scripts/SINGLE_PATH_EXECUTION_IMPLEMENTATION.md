# Single-Path Execution Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of the Single-Path Execution Pattern for Issue #52. The implementation provides a framework for eliminating multiple conditional execution paths in workflows to create predictable, deterministic execution suitable for automation.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. SinglePathExecutor (`claude/wow/scripts/lib/single-path-execution.js`)
The main execution engine that enforces single-path execution patterns:

- **Precondition Validation**: Ensures all requirements are met before execution
- **State Normalization**: Brings system to consistent state before operation
- **Single-Path Execution**: Executes operation without conditional branches
- **Postcondition Validation**: Verifies operation completed successfully
- **Event Emission**: Emits success/error events for automation

#### 2. Workflow Orchestrators (`claude/wow/scripts/lib/workflow-orchestration.js`)
Specific orchestration implementations for different workflows:

- **CommitWorkflowOrchestrator**: Deterministic commit operations with issue closure
- **SessionStartWorkflowOrchestrator**: Predictable session initialization
- **InboxWorkflowOrchestrator**: Deterministic inbox task processing
- **NextIssueWorkflowOrchestrator**: Consistent issue recommendation scoring

#### 3. Common Validators and Normalizers
Reusable components for validation and state management:

- **PreconditionValidators**: Git repo, Claude structure, GitHub auth, issue cache
- **PostconditionValidators**: Git state, file content validation
- **StateNormalizers**: Git working directory, cache state, directory structure

## Implementation Details

### Single-Path Execution Pattern

The framework enforces a five-phase execution pattern:

```javascript
async execute(operation, context = {}) {
    // Phase 1: Precondition Validation
    await this.validatePreconditions(operation);
    
    // Phase 2: State Normalization
    await this.normalizeState(operation);
    
    // Phase 3: Single-Path Execution
    const result = await this.executeOperation(operation);
    
    // Phase 4: Postcondition Validation
    await this.validatePostconditions(operation);
    
    // Phase 5: Event Emission
    await this.emitSuccess(operation, result);
    
    return { success: true, operation, result, context };
}
```

### Workflow Orchestration Examples

#### COMMIT Workflow
**Before**: Multiple conditional paths based on cache state and issue presence
**After**: Single deterministic path with normalization

```javascript
// State normalization ensures consistent starting point
async normalizeCommitState(context) {
    execSync('git add -A'); // Ensure all changes are staged
    const detectedIssues = await this.detectResolvedIssues();
    context.resolvedIssues = detectedIssues;
    await this.ensureCacheIsCurrentForIssues(detectedIssues);
    context.commitMessage = await this.generateCommitMessage(detectedIssues);
}

// Single execution path based on normalized state
async executeCommitWithIssueClosure(context) {
    const { commitMessage, resolvedIssues } = context;
    
    // Step 1: Create commit
    execSync(`git commit -m "${commitMessage}"`);
    
    // Step 2: Push to remote
    execSync('git push origin main');
    
    // Step 3: Close issues (cache-first approach)
    for (const issueNumber of resolvedIssues) {
        await this.github.closeIssue(issueNumber);
    }
}
```

#### NEXT_ISSUE Workflow
**Before**: Complex conditional scoring with multiple paths
**After**: Deterministic scoring algorithm with single recommendation path

```javascript
async executeNextIssueRecommendation(context) {
    const { openIssues, scoringCriteria } = context;
    
    // Score all open issues deterministically
    const issueScores = openIssues.map(issue => {
        const score = this.calculateIssueScore(issue, scoringCriteria);
        return { issue, score, breakdown: score.breakdown };
    });
    
    // Sort by score (deterministic)
    issueScores.sort((a, b) => b.score.total - a.score.total);
    
    // Select top issue
    const recommendedIssue = issueScores[0].issue;
    
    return {
        recommendedIssue: {
            number: recommendedIssue.number,
            title: recommendedIssue.title,
            score: issueScores[0].score.total
        }
    };
}
```

## Testing and Validation

### CLI Testing Interface
Each workflow orchestrator includes a CLI interface for testing:

```bash
# Test individual workflows
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/workflow-orchestration.js commit test
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/workflow-orchestration.js session-start test
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/workflow-orchestration.js inbox test
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/workflow-orchestration.js next-issue test

# Test single-path execution framework
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/single-path-execution.js test-git
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/single-path-execution.js test-claude
node claude/wow/scripts/lib/single-path-execution.js test-github
```

### Test Mode Support
The framework includes test mode support that skips state normalization:

```javascript
// Skip normalization in test mode
if (context.test) {
    context.normalizedGitState = 'test';
    return;
}
```

## Performance Benefits

### Predictable Execution
- **Before**: Multiple conditional paths with varying execution times
- **After**: Single deterministic path with consistent performance

### Reduced Complexity
- **Before**: Complex branching logic difficult to debug
- **After**: Linear execution flow with clear validation checkpoints

### Automation Ready
- **Before**: Conditional behavior makes automation unpredictable
- **After**: Deterministic execution suitable for event-driven automation

## Integration Points

### Existing Workflows
The single-path execution framework integrates with:
- **GitHub API Scripts**: Uses native fetch-based GitHub API client
- **Issue Cache System**: Leverages intelligent caching for performance
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging at each execution phase

### Future Enhancements
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Event emission prepares for choreography
- **Workflow Composition**: Single-path tools can be composed into larger flows
- **Distributed Execution**: Deterministic execution enables distributed processing

## Error Handling

### Comprehensive Validation
Each phase includes comprehensive error handling:

```javascript
// Precondition validation with detailed error context
if (!result.valid) {
    const error = new Error(`Precondition failed for ${operation}: ${result.message}`);
    error.code = 'PRECONDITION_FAILED';
    error.operation = operation;
    error.details = result.details;
    throw error;
}
```

### State Recovery
State normalizers handle recovery from inconsistent states:

```javascript
switch (desiredState) {
    case 'clean':
        // Don't modify git state - just ensure it's clean
        break;
    case 'committed':
        // Ensure all changes are committed
        if (uncommitted.trim().length > 0) {
            execSync('git add -A');
            execSync('git commit -m "Auto-commit for state normalization"');
        }
        break;
}
```
