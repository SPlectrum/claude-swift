- **Current Phase**: Template creation and cleanup
- **Active Tasks**:
  - ‚úÖ Document project overview and objectives (`docs/preliminary/project-overview.md`)
  - ‚úÖ Document self-contained template update architecture (`docs/preliminary/self-contained-template-update-architecture.md`)
  - ‚úÖ Document template repository structure (`docs/preliminary/template-repository-structure.md`)
  - ‚úÖ Document event-driven workflow testing architecture (`docs/preliminary/event-driven-workflow-testing-architecture.md`)
  - ‚è≥ Design folder structure for template vs local operational data separation
  - ‚è≥ Define upgrade rules to prevent overwriting local operational data  
  - ‚è≥ Create deployment mechanism for template to project repositories
  - ‚è≥ Clean up existing `/claude/` operational data (remove project-specific content)
- **Architecture Goal**: Template repository that can deploy to any project with upgrade-safe mechanisms
- **Future Evolution**: Clone this repo to create different template variants as needed
