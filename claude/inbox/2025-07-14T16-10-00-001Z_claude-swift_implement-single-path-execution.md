# Implement Single-Path Execution Pattern

## Description
Remove all conditional execution paths from workflows to create deterministic, automation-ready operations. This is critical for the transition to event-driven choreography where each operation must have predictable behavior in both interactive and automated modes.

Key areas to refactor:
- COMMIT workflow issue closure (already started)
- SESSION_START uncommitted work handling
- ISSUE_CACHE sync operations
- CREATE_ISSUE cache checking

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Single-path execution is fundamental to automation. Without it, event-driven choreography cannot work reliably as different paths produce different events and states.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Event-driven choreography implementation
**Blocked by:** None
**Related:** CLAUDE_DUAL_MODE.md optimization documentation

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Large effort due to multiple workflows requiring refactoring and testing to ensure single-path execution doesn't break existing functionality

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] All workflows have single execution paths (no if/else for same operation)
- [ ] Each operation has clear preconditions that halt execution if not met
- [ ] Each operation emits consistent postconditions/events
- [ ] Workflows work identically in both modes (only UI differs)
- [ ] No "if cached then X else Y" patterns remain
- [ ] All operations are deterministic and repeatable

## Work Area: workflow-optimization
**Context:** Based on optimization analysis in SINGLE_PATH_OPTIMIZATION.md. The goal is to ensure every workflow operation follows the pattern:
1. Validate preconditions (fail fast)
2. Execute operation (single path)
3. Emit events/postconditions
