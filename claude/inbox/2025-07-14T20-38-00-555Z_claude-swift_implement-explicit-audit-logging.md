# Implement Explicit Audit Logging Throughout System

## Description
Replace item-triggered audit logging pattern with explicit audit logging in all workflows to provide real-time visibility, better debugging, and event-ready architecture. Currently most workflows have audit step markers but no actual logging implementation.

Building on the successful Node.js audit logging foundation (`claude/scripts/audit-functions.sh`), implement explicit logging in key workflows to provide:
- Real-time execution visibility
- Better debugging capabilities  
- Event emission readiness
- Performance optimization through batching

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** This completes the audit logging modernization started with Node.js implementation. Explicit logging is critical for debugging complex workflows and preparing for event-driven choreography.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Event-driven choreography implementation, workflow debugging improvements
**Blocked by:** None (Node.js audit functions already implemented)
**Related:** OUTBOX workflows (already implemented), batch operations optimization

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Large effort as it requires updating multiple workflows with comprehensive explicit logging while maintaining backward compatibility and testing all implementations.

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] COMMIT workflow has explicit audit logging at each major step
- [ ] SESSION_START workflow logs initialization steps explicitly
- [ ] SESSION_END workflow logs cleanup operations
- [ ] ISSUE_CACHE workflow logs cache operations in real-time
- [ ] CREATE_ISSUE workflow logs issue creation steps
- [ ] INBOX workflow logs task processing steps
- [ ] All workflows use `source claude/scripts/audit-functions.sh`
- [ ] Batch logging implemented where multiple operations occur
- [ ] Error conditions logged with context
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable (reduced debugging time)

## Work Area: workflow-optimization
**Context:** This builds on the Node.js audit logging foundation already implemented and tested in OUTBOX workflows. The pattern is proven:

```bash
# Add to each workflow
source claude/scripts/audit-functions.sh

# Use explicit logging
audit_log "WORKFLOW" "start" "operation" "" "Starting major operation"
# ... do work with visibility
audit_log "WORKFLOW" "step" "validation" "" "Validation completed"
# ... more work
audit_log "WORKFLOW" "complete" "operation" "" "Operation completed successfully"
```

Key workflows needing implementation:
- claude/wow/workflows/COMMIT.md
- claude/wow/workflows/SESSION_START.md  
- claude/wow/workflows/SESSION_END.md
- claude/wow/workflows/ISSUE_CACHE.md
- claude/wow/workflows/CREATE_ISSUE.md
- claude/wow/workflows/INBOX.md

This will provide the real-time workflow visibility needed for efficient development and debugging while preparing the foundation for event-driven choreography.
