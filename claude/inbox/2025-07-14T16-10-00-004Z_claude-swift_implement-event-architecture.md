# Implement Event-Ready Architecture Foundation

## Description
Add event emission infrastructure to existing workflows to prepare for event-driven choreography. This creates the foundation for transitioning from monolithic workflows to choreographed tools while maintaining backward compatibility.

Key implementations:
- Standardized event emission function
- Event logging infrastructure
- Instrument existing workflows with events
- Tool extraction preparation
- Dual-mode execution patterns

## Priority: MEDIUM
**Justification:** While critical for the long-term roadmap, this can be implemented gradually after the performance optimizations. The infrastructure enables future choreography without breaking current functionality.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Event-driven choreography, distributed execution
**Blocked by:** Single-path execution (events need deterministic operations)
**Related:** All workflow optimizations, CLAUDE_DUAL_MODE.md

## Effort: XL
**Estimate:** Extra large effort as it touches all workflows and requires careful design to maintain compatibility while preparing for the future architecture.

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] emit_event() function implemented and standardized
- [ ] Event log infrastructure created (claude/project/events/)
- [ ] Major workflows instrumented with event emissions
- [ ] Events follow standardized format
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Documentation for event types and contracts
- [ ] Example tool extraction completed (e.g., stage_files_tool)

## Work Area: workflow-optimization
**Context:** Based on EVENT_READY_ARCHITECTURE.md. This is a gradual implementation:

Phase 1: Add event infrastructure without changing behavior
Phase 2: Instrument workflows with events
Phase 3: Extract first tools from workflows
Phase 4: Create choreography definitions

Start with non-breaking additions that lay groundwork for future choreography while maintaining all current functionality.
