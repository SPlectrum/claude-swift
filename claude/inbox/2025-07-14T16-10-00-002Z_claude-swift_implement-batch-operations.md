# Implement Batch Operations for Audit Logging and API Calls

## Description
Replace individual operations with batch processing to dramatically reduce I/O overhead and improve performance. This optimization is essential for efficient automated execution where thousands of operations may occur.

Key implementations:
- Batch audit logging (collect entries, write once)
- Batch GitHub API operations
- Batch file operations
- Atomic transaction semantics

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** Current individual audit log appends create significant I/O overhead. Batch operations can reduce file I/O by 80% and API calls by similar amounts, directly impacting system performance.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** High-frequency automated execution
**Blocked by:** None (can use audit_log function from AUDIT_LOGGING.md)
**Related:** Standardized audit logging function

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Medium effort as the patterns are clear and can be implemented incrementally. Start with audit logging as highest impact.

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] Audit logging uses batch append at workflow completion
- [ ] Issue operations batched (cache updates + GitHub API)
- [ ] File operations support batch creation/modification
- [ ] Batch boundaries clearly defined (workflow end, error boundary)
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable (target: 80% I/O reduction)
- [ ] Error handling maintains atomicity

## Work Area: workflow-optimization
**Context:** Based on BATCH_OPERATIONS.md optimization guide. Priority order:
1. Audit log batching (highest impact, easiest)
2. Issue operation batching (cache + API)
3. File operation batching

The implementation should maintain atomicity - either all operations in a batch succeed or all fail with proper rollback.
