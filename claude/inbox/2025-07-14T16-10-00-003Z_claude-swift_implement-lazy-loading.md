# Implement Lazy Loading and Caching Strategy

## Description
Replace eager loading of resources with on-demand loading to reduce startup overhead and improve responsiveness. This optimization enables fast workflow startup and efficient resource usage.

Key implementations:
- Lazy issue cache (load issues only when accessed)
- Remove mandatory rule scanning from SESSION_START
- Incremental cache updates instead of full rebuilds
- Memory-first caching layer

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** SESSION_START currently takes ~10 seconds due to eager loading. Lazy loading can reduce this to <1 second, dramatically improving user experience and enabling rapid automated execution.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Fast session initialization, quick workflow execution
**Blocked by:** None
**Related:** SESSION_START workflow, ISSUE_CACHE workflow

## Effort: M
**Estimate:** Medium effort - requires refactoring cache access patterns but doesn't change fundamental logic. Can be implemented incrementally.

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] SESSION_START completes in <2 seconds (from ~10s)
- [ ] Issue cache loads individual issues on demand
- [ ] Mandatory rule scanning only runs when explicitly needed
- [ ] Memory cache layer implemented for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Incremental cache updates working (no full rebuilds)
- [ ] API calls reduced by caching strategy

## Work Area: workflow-optimization
**Context:** Based on LAZY_LOADING.md patterns. Implementation priority:
1. Remove mandatory scanning from SESSION_START (biggest win)
2. Implement lazy issue cache access
3. Add memory caching layer
4. Convert to incremental updates

The goal is to make workflows start instantly and load resources only as needed, supporting both interactive responsiveness and automated efficiency.
