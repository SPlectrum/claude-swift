# Implement JavaScript Workflow Tools Foundation

## Description
Replace bash-heavy operations with modern JavaScript tools to eliminate complexity, improve reliability, and accelerate development. Building on the successful Node.js audit logging foundation, add powerful JavaScript libraries to handle GitHub API operations, file system management, and template generation.

This will transform workflow development from "fighting with bash" to "building with modern JavaScript capabilities" while providing the foundation for event-driven choreography.

## Priority: HIGH
**Justification:** These tools will eliminate 80% of current bash pain points and dramatically accelerate all future workflow development. The ROI is immediate - every workflow becomes easier to write, debug, and maintain.

## Dependencies
**Blocks:** Efficient explicit audit logging implementation, complex workflow development
**Blocked by:** None (builds on existing Node.js foundation)
**Related:** Explicit audit logging task, event-driven choreography roadmap

## Effort: L
**Estimate:** Large effort due to comprehensive implementation across multiple tools and integration with existing workflows, but high value and clear implementation path.

## Test Criteria
**How to verify completion:**
- [ ] GitHub API client (@octokit/rest) integrated and working
- [ ] File operations library (glob, fs/promises) replacing bash find/mv operations
- [ ] Template engine (handlebars) for consistent task/issue generation
- [ ] JSON schema validation (ajv) for configuration and task files
- [ ] Date/time handling (luxon) replacing bash date commands
- [ ] Configuration management system implemented
- [ ] OUTBOX workflow converted to use JavaScript tools
- [ ] Performance improvement measurable (faster execution, fewer errors)
- [ ] All tools documented with examples in claude/scripts/
- [ ] Integration tests passing for all JavaScript components

## Work Area: workflow-optimization
**Context:** Based on analysis in `claude/wow/optimizations/JAVASCRIPT_TOOLS_ANALYSIS.md`. 

### Implementation Priority:

**Phase 1 - Foundation (Immediate Impact):**
1. **GitHub API Client** - Replace `gh` CLI with `@octokit/rest`
2. **File Operations** - Replace bash find/mv with `glob` + `fs/promises`  
3. **Template Engine** - Replace heredocs with `handlebars`

**Phase 2 - Robustness:**
4. **JSON Schema Validation** - Add `ajv` for data validation
5. **Date/Time Handling** - Replace bash date with `luxon`
6. **Configuration Management** - Centralized settings with `cosmiconfig`

**Phase 3 - Orchestration:**
7. **Workflow Engine** - Event-driven choreography foundation

### Key Benefits:
- **90% reduction** in GitHub operation complexity
- **Bulletproof file operations** with atomic transactions
- **Zero formatting errors** with templates
- **Type safety** and IDE support
- **Parallel processing** capabilities
- **Cross-platform compatibility**

### Example Transformation:
```bash
# Current bash nightmare
TARGET_PATH=$(python3 -c "import json; ..." 2>/dev/null)

# Clean JavaScript
const project = registry.registered_projects.find(p => 
  p.repository.split('/')[1] === targetRepo
)
```

This builds directly on our Node.js audit logging success and provides the modern tooling foundation needed for efficient workflow development and future event-driven architecture.
