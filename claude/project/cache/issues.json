Users need to clone the repository and manually extract the template, which is inconvenient and doesn't guarantee they get the exact release state.\n\n## Problem\n\n- GitHub releases exist but have no downloadable template package\n- Users must clone repo and navigate git to get template for specific release\n- No easy way to deploy a specific \"point in time\" release\n- ARTIFACT_COMMANDS are documented in version-config.md but not executed\n\n## Solution\n\nImplement automatic template packaging during release creation:\n\n1. **Execute ARTIFACT_COMMANDS** during release workflow:\n   - Create artifact directory with template files\n   - Copy docs/, CLAUDE.md, README.md, release notes\n   - Package into .7z archive\n\n2. **Attach package to GitHub release**:\n   - Upload generated .7z file as release asset\n   - Users can download complete template package directly\n\n3. **Update RELEASE_PROCESS workflow**:\n   - Add artifact generation step\n   - Add asset upload step\n   - Validate package contents\n\n## Current Infrastructure\n\nARTIFACT_COMMANDS already documented in `claude/project/version-config.md`:\n```\n\"ARTIFACT_COMMANDS\": [\n  \"cp -r template/ {ARTIFACT_NAME}/\",\n  \"cp -r docs/ {ARTIFACT_NAME}/docs/\", \n  \"cp CLAUDE.md {ARTIFACT_NAME}/\",\n  \"cp README.md {ARTIFACT_NAME}/\",\n  \"cp template/CLAUDE-SWIFT-v1.0.1-RELEASE-NOTES.md {ARTIFACT_NAME}/CLAUDE-SWIFT-v1.0.1-RELEASE-NOTES.md\",\n  \"7z a {ARTIFACT_NAME}.7z {ARTIFACT_NAME}/\"\n]\n```\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- [ ] RELEASE_PROCESS workflow executes artifact commands\n- [ ] Generated .7z package attached to GitHub releases\n- [ ] Users can download complete template package for any release\n- [ ] Package contains all necessary files for deployment\n- [ ] No template package files stored in repository (only as release assets)\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Easy deployment**: Download and extract specific release template\n- **Version precision**: Guaranteed exact state for any release\n- **User convenience**: No git knowledge required for template usage\n- **Clean repository**: No large binary files in version control",

    "body": "## Summary\nCreate workflows to handle asynchronous task communication between repositories using inbox/outbox folder pattern. This enables repositories to raise tasks for other repositories without direct coupling.\n\n## Core Concept\n- **OUTBOX**: Repository places task files here for delivery to other repositories\n- **INBOX**: Repository receives task files here from other repositories\n- **Delivery**: claude-swift acts as the message broker, moving files from outbox to appropriate inbox\n- **Processing**: Time-based ascending order ensures FIFO task handling\n\n## Required Workflows\n\n### 1. OUTBOX_TASK Workflow\n**Trigger**: `outbox [repository] [task-name] sesame`\n**Purpose**: Create task file in outbox for another repository\n\n**Features**:\n- [ ] Generate task file with standardized naming: `TIMESTAMP_TARGET-REPO_TASK-NAME.md`\n- [ ] Include task metadata (source repo, timestamp, priority, description)\n- [ ] Validate target repository exists in sesameh organization\n- [ ] Support task templates for common operations\n- [ ] Log task creation in audit log\n\n**File Format Example**:\n```\noutbox/2025-07-13T10-30-00Z_spl1_migrate-to-v2.md\noutbox/2025-07-13T10-31-00Z_InfoMetis_update-workflows.md\n```\n\n### 2. INBOX_PROCESS Workflow  \n**Trigger**: `inbox sesame` or `process inbox sesame`\n**Purpose**: Process received tasks in chronological order\n\n**Features**:\n- [ ] Scan inbox folder for unprocessed tasks\n- [ ] Sort by timestamp (ascending order for FIFO)\n- [ ] Parse task metadata and requirements\n- [ ] Execute or queue tasks based on type\n- [ ] Move processed tasks to inbox/archive/\n- [ ] Generate processing report\n\n### 3. TASK_DELIVERY Workflow (claude-swift internal)\n**Purpose**: Move files from source outbox to target inbox\n\n**Features**:\n- [ ] Scan all repositories for outbox entries\n- [ ] Parse target repository from filename\n- [ ] Validate target repository accessibility\n- [ ] Copy file to target inbox with delivery timestamp\n- [ ] Move original to outbox/delivered/\n- [ ] Handle delivery failures gracefully\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### Task File Structure\n```markdown\n---\nsource: claude-swift\ntarget: spl1\ncreated: 2025-07-13T10:30:00Z\npriority: normal\ntype: workflow-update\n---\n\n# Task: Migrate to v2 Workflows\n\n## Description\nUpdate spl1 repository to use latest v2 workflow patterns from claude-swift.\n\n## Requirements\n- [ ] Update SESSION_START workflow\n- [ ] Add new MANDATORY_RULES_REFRESH workflow\n- [ ] Test all sesame triggers\n\n## Context\nFollowing claude-swift v1.1.0 release, all dependent repositories need workflow updates.\n```\n\n### Directory Structure\n```\nrepository/\n├── inbox/\n│   ├── pending/          # Unprocessed tasks\n│   ├── archive/          # Processed tasks\n│   └── failed/           # Tasks that failed processing\n├── outbox/\n│   ├── pending/          # Tasks awaiting delivery\n│   ├── delivered/        # Successfully delivered tasks\n│   └── failed/           # Undeliverable tasks\n```\n\n### Filename Encoding Pattern\n`TIMESTAMP_TARGET-REPO_TASK-NAME.md`\n- **TIMESTAMP**: ISO 8601 format with hyphens (2025-07-13T10-30-00Z)\n- **TARGET-REPO**: Repository name within sesameh organization\n- **TASK-NAME**: Descriptive task identifier with hyphens\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Cross-repository task communication working\n- [ ] Tasks processed in correct chronological order\n- [ ] Delivery mechanism reliable and traceable\n- [ ] Failed deliveries handled gracefully\n- [ ] Complete audit trail for all operations\n- [ ] Integration with existing workflow patterns\n\n## Integration Points\n- **AUDIT_LOGGING**: Track all inbox/outbox operations\n- **SESSION_START**: Check inbox for new tasks\n- **PROJECT_SWITCH**: Consider inbox/outbox when switching projects\n- **Git Operations**: Inbox/outbox folders in .gitignore\n\n## Security Considerations\n- Validate task sources to prevent unauthorized task injection\n- Sanitize task content to prevent malicious payloads\n- Limit task execution permissions\n- Audit all cross-repository operations\n\n## Labels\n- `enhancement` - New workflow feature\n- `v1.1.0` - Part of workspace framework\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

    "body": "## Summary\nTransition to a main-only commit workflow as the most efficient pattern for creative collaborative AI work. This requires removing all references to branch management, pull requests, and multi-branch workflows throughout the codebase.\n\n## Rationale\n- **Efficiency**: Direct commits to main eliminate overhead of branch management\n- **AI Collaboration**: Claude works in single sessions, making branches unnecessary\n- **Simplicity**: Reduces cognitive load and workflow complexity\n- **Trust**: Relies on AI accuracy and human oversight rather than process gates\n\n## Required Changes\n\n### 1. Workflow Files to Update\n- [ ] **GIT_WORKFLOW.md** - Remove all branching strategies, PR creation, branch switching\n- [ ] **SESSION_END.md** - Remove PR requirements, simplify to direct commits\n- [ ] **SESSION_START.md** - Remove branch checking, uncommitted work assessment\n- [ ] **OPERATIONAL_RULES.md** - Update collaboration patterns for main-only\n- [ ] **RELEASE_PROCESS.md** - Simplify release from main branch only\n- [ ] **PLANNED_VS_UNPLANNED.md** - Remove planned/unplanned branch distinction\n- [ ] **VERSION_TRANSITION.md** - Update for main-only development\n\n### 2. Documentation Updates\n- [ ] **branching-strategy.md** - Delete or replace with main-only strategy\n- [ ] **CLAUDE.md** - Remove all branch management references\n- [ ] **README.md** - Update development workflow description\n- [ ] All docs referencing PRs or branches need updating\n\n### 3. Specific Removals\n**Remove concepts of**:\n- [ ] Feature branches\n- [ ] Development branches  \n- [ ] Pull requests / PRs\n- [ ] Branch merging\n- [ ] Branch protection rules\n- [ ] PR reviews\n- [ ] Branch naming conventions\n- [ ] Unplanned vs planned branches\n\n**Remove commands like**:\n- [ ] `git checkout -b`\n- [ ] `git merge`\n- [ ] `git branch`\n- [ ] `gh pr create`\n- [ ] Any branch switching logic\n\n### 4. New Simplified Git Pattern\n```bash\n# All work happens on main\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Description of changes\"\ngit push origin main\n```\n\n### 5. Update Audit Patterns\n- [ ] Remove branch tracking from audit logs\n- [ ] Simplify git operation logging\n- [ ] Remove PR-related audit entries\n\n### 6. Configuration Updates\n- [ ] Remove branch-related configuration\n- [ ] Update any CI/CD to work with main only\n- [ ] Simplify git aliases and helpers\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n### Phase 1: Scan and Document\n1. Use grep/ripgrep to find all references to:\n   - \"branch\", \"branches\", \"branching\"\n   - \"PR\", \"pull request\", \"merge\"\n   - \"checkout -b\", \"git branch\"\n   - \"planned\", \"unplanned\" (in branch context)\n\n### Phase 2: Update Core Workflows\n1. Start with GIT_WORKFLOW.md as central source\n2. Update SESSION_START/SESSION_END workflows\n3. Revise OPERATIONAL_RULES for new pattern\n\n### Phase 3: Clean Documentation\n1. Remove or archive old branching documentation\n2. Create new \"main-only-workflow.md\" if needed\n3. Update all cross-references\n\n### Phase 4: Validation\n1. Test all workflows with main-only pattern\n2. Ensure audit logging works correctly\n3. Verify session management simplified\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Zero references to branch management remain\n- [ ] All workflows operate on main branch only\n- [ ] Git operations significantly simplified\n- [ ] Documentation reflects new approach\n- [ ] Audit patterns updated accordingly\n- [ ] No breaking changes to core functionality\n\n## Benefits Expected\n- **50%+ reduction** in git-related workflow steps\n- **Faster sessions** without branch overhead\n- **Clearer commits** without merge commits\n- **Simplified training** for new users\n- **Better AI alignment** with single-context work\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n- Ensure good commit messages for history\n- Maintain robust backup strategy\n- Consider commit signing for accountability\n- Regular repository backups recommended\n\n## Note\nThis is a breaking change that fundamentally alters the git workflow patterns.

    "body": "## Summary\nModify SESSION_START workflow to automatically execute SESSION_END when significant uncommitted work is detected, with user approval requested when significance is unclear.\n\n## Current Problem\n- SESSION_START detects uncommitted work but requires manual decision\n- Risk of losing work or improper session boundaries\n- Complexity in determining appropriate actions\n\n## Proposed Solution\nWhen SESSION_START detects uncommitted work:\n1. **Significant work detected** → Automatically execute SESSION_END\n2. **Significance unclear** → Ask user for approval\n3. **Insignificant work** → Discard as currently implemented\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n### 1. Update Uncommitted Work Check Section\nReplace current \"Handle Appropriately\" logic with:\n```markdown\n**Uncommitted Work Actions:**\n1. **Significant Changes Detected**:\n   - Automatically execute SESSION_END workflow\n   - Complete proper commit and session closure\n   - Resume SESSION_START after SESSION_END completes\n\n2. **Unclear Significance**:\n   - Present changes to user with: `git diff --stat`\n   - Ask: \"Uncommitted changes detected. Are these significant? (yes/no)\"\n   - If yes: Execute SESSION_END\n   - If no: Discard with `git checkout .`\n\n3. **Insignificant Changes**:\n   - Discard without commit (current behavior)\n```\n\n### 2. Significance Detection Rules\n**Automatically Significant:**\n- Any audit log entries for current session beyond SESSION_START\n- Code changes (*.js, *.py, *.md in src/, lib/, etc.)\n- Configuration file changes\n- New files created\n- Workflow modifications\n\n**Requires User Approval:**\n- Documentation-only changes\n- README updates\n- Minor formatting changes\n- Changes without audit trail\n\n### 3. SESSION_END Integration\n- SESSION_END should complete fully before resuming SESSION_START\n- Clear message: \"Completing previous session before starting new one...\"\n- Maintain session continuity in audit logs\n\n## Benefits\n- **Prevents work loss** - Significant work always properly committed\n- **Cleaner boundaries** - Sessions properly closed before new ones\n- **Reduced complexity** - Automatic handling of common case\n- **User control** - Approval requested only when needed\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] SESSION_START automatically triggers SESSION_END for significant work\n- [ ] User approval mechanism works for unclear cases\n- [ ] No work lost between sessions\n- [ ] Audit logs show clear session boundaries\n- [ ] Simplified decision tree in workflow\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n1. Start session with significant uncommitted work → Should auto-execute SESSION_END\n2. Start session with formatting changes only → Should request approval\n3. Start session with no changes → Should proceed normally\n4. Start session after interrupted SESSION_END → Should complete recovery\n\n## Prerequisites for Main-Only Workflow\nThis change simplifies SESSION_START and makes it easier to later remove branch management (issue #40), as session boundaries will be cleaner.\n\n## Labels\n- `enhancement` - Workflow improvement\n- `v1.1.0` - Part of workflow optimization\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)",

Essential for clean workflow architecture.\n\n## Dependencies\n**Blocks:** Workflow development guide creation, clean workflow directory structure\n**Blocked by:** None (builds on existing Node.js audit implementation)\n**Related:** Explicit audit logging implementation (completed)\n\n## Effort: M\n**Estimate:** Medium effort to consolidate guidance, update references, and ensure smooth transition from workflow to reference.\n\n## Test Criteria\n**How to verify completion:**\n- [ ] Created `claude/scripts/AUDIT_REFERENCE.md` with comprehensive function reference\n- [ ] Included audit logging patterns for workflow development\n- [ ] Removed `claude/wow/workflows/AUDIT_LOGGING.md`\n- [ ] Updated all workflow references to point to new audit reference location\n- [ ] Updated KEYWORD_REGISTRY to remove AUDIT_LOGGING workflow trigger\n- [ ] Verified no broken links or references to old audit workflow\n- [ ] All existing workflows continue to use audit functions correctly\n- [ ] Documentation explains when and how to add audit logging to workflows\n\n## Work Area: workflow-optimization\n**Context:** Part of streamlining workflow documentation to distinguish between executable workflows and reference materials. Audit logging is tooling, not a workflow.\n\n### Implementation Steps:\n1. **Create audit reference**: Move function documentation to `claude/scripts/AUDIT_REFERENCE.md`\n2. **Add workflow guidance**: Include patterns for when/how to add audit logging\n3. **Remove old workflow**: Delete `claude/wow/workflows/AUDIT_LOGGING.md`\n4. **Update references**: Fix all links and keyword registry entries\n5. **Validate workflows**: Ensure existing workflows still use audit functions correctly\n\nThis creates a cleaner separation between executable workflows and developer reference materials.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies\n**Blocks:** None (unless specified in task content)\n**Blocked by:** None (unless specified in task content)  \n**Related:** Cross-repository communication\n\n## Test Criteria\nSee task content above for specific verification steps.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) via INBOX workflow\n\nCross-repository task from claude-swift processed automatically.",

This serves as the practical validation of the operational philosophy being documented in SPlectrum, creating a concrete implementation that other systems can reference.\r\n\r\nThe prototype transforms workflows from \"fail fast\" to \"succeed fast, fix later\" through intelligent exception handling that creates actionable work items for infrastructure problems while ensuring primary functions always complete.\r\n\r\n## Priority: HIGH\r\n**Justification:** This prototype validates the operational pattern theory with practical implementation, providing concrete examples for SPlectrum documentation and establishing claude-swift as reference implementation for resilient operational patterns.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n**Blocks:** Operational pattern validation, reference implementation for other SPlectrum systems\r\n**Blocked by:** None (builds on existing workflow infrastructure and Node.js audit logging)\r\n**Related:** SPlectrum operational philosophy documentation task, INBOX milestone handling improvements\r\n\r\n## Effort: L\r\n**Estimate:** Large effort due to comprehensive implementation across multiple workflows, creation of deferred exception infrastructure, and validation of pattern effectiveness.\r\n\r\n## Test Criteria\r\n**How to verify completion:**\r\n- [ ] Created deferred exception infrastructure in `claude/wow/scripts/lib/exceptions.js`\r\n- [ ] Implemented automatic bug task creation for infrastructure problems\r\n- [ ] Enhanced INBOX workflow with full deferred exception handling\r\n- [ ] Created audit logging enhancements for warning classification\r\n- [ ] Updated SESSION_START workflow with deferred exception patterns\r\n- [ ] Updated ISSUE_CACHE workflow with resilient error handling\r\n- [ ] Created decision framework implementation for exception classification\r\n- [ ] Implemented orphaned issue tracking and retroactive assignment\r\n- [ ] Added comprehensive testing for deferred exception scenarios\r\n- [ ] Documented prototype implementation patterns for reference\r\n\r\n## Work Area: operational-patterns\r\n**Context:** Practical implementation of the operational philosophy pattern discovered during INBOX milestone handling development. This prototype serves as validation and reference for SPlectrum systems.\r\n\r\n### Implementation Components:\r\n\r\n**1. Deferred Exception Infrastructure**\r\n```javascript\r\n// claude/wow/scripts/lib/exceptions.js\r\nclass DeferredException {\r\n  constructor(type, description, affectedItems, remediation) {\r\n    this.type = type;\r\n    this.description = description;\r\n    this.affectedItems = affectedItems;\r\n    this.remediation = remediation;\r\n    this.timestamp = new Date().toISOString();\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  createTask() {\r\n    // Generate self-targeted bug task\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**2. Enhanced INBOX Implementation**\r\n- Missing milestone detection → Bug task creation\r\n- Orphaned issue tracking → Retroactive assignment task\r\n- Cache inconsistency → Maintenance task generation\r\n- Primary function (issue creation) always succeeds\r\n\r\n**3. Audit Log Warning Classification**\r\n- Environmental issues → Audit warnings only\r\n- Performance degradation → Monitoring data\r\n- Transient failures → Warning logs\r\n- Infrastructure gaps → Deferred exception tasks\r\n\r\n**4. Decision Framework Implementation**\r\n```bash\r\nhandle_exception() {\r\n  local problem=\"$1\"\r\n  local context=\"$2\"\r\n  \r\n  if can_create_task_to_fix \"$problem\"; then\r\n    create_deferred_exception_task \"$problem\" \"$context\"\r\n  elif is_immediate_failure \"$problem\"; then\r\n    exit 1  # Fail fast for critical issues\r\n  else\r\n    audit_log \"WARNING\" \"environmental\" \"$problem\" \"\" \"$context\"\r\n  fi\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**5. Self-Repair Mechanics**\r\n- Automatic bug task generation\r\n- Affected item tracking (issue numbers, file paths)\r\n- Clear remediation steps in generated tasks\r\n- Integration with existing workflow infrastructure\r\n\r\n**6. Prototype Validation**\r\n- Test scenarios for each exception type\r\n- Validation of primary function preservation\r\n- Measurement of operational debt visibility\r\n- Comparison with traditional fail-fast approaches\r\n\r\n### Integration Points:\r\n- **INBOX**: Missing milestone → Bug task + continue processing\r\n- **SESSION_START**: Missing cache → Rebuild task + continue session\r\n- **ISSUE_CACHE**: Sync failures → Retry task + use stale cache\r\n- **CREATE_ISSUE**: API failures → Manual creation task + continue\r\n\r\n### Success Metrics:\r\n- **Resilience**: Primary functions complete despite infrastructure problems\r\n- **Visibility**: Infrastructure debt becomes tracked work items\r\n- **Automation**: Self-repair tasks provide clear remediation paths\r\n- **Reference**: Other systems can adopt proven patterns\r\n\r\nThis prototype establishes claude-swift as the reference implementation for resilient operational patterns while providing practical validation of the theoretical framework being developed in SPlectrum.\r\n\r\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n**Blocks:** None (unless specified in task content)\r\n**Blocked by:** None (unless specified in task content)  \r\n**Related:** Cross-repository communication\r\n\r\n## Effort: M\r\n**Estimate:** Cross-repository task processing\r\n\r\n## Test Criteria\r\n**How to verify completion:**\r\n- [ ] Task requirements completed as specified\r\n- [ ] Cross-repository coordination successful\r\n\r\n## Work Area: cross-repository\r\n**Context:** Task distributed via OUTBOX/INBOX workflow\r\n\r\n*This issue was automatically created from an inbox task by the INBOX workflow.*",
