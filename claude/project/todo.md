# Repository Todo List

## Version Transition to v1.1.0 (2025-06-26)

**VERSION_TRANSITION Workflow Steps**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] 1. Audit Log Analysis and Processing - Analyzed 304 audit entries, created dual reports
- [x] 2. Knowledge Base Synchronization - Updated architecture documentation with v1.0.0 insights
- [x] 3. Repository Maintenance and Cleanup - Fixed broken references, synchronized template system
- [x] 4. Strategic Analysis and Operational Reporting - Created comprehensive strategic analysis with v1.1.0 recommendations
- [x] 5. User-Facing Reports and Knowledge Base Updates - Built knowledge base with collaboration patterns, best practices, workflow effectiveness
- [x] 6. Get Started Documentation - Created practical onboarding guides based on real deployment experience
- [x] **Note**: Step 7 removed as redundant (objectives accomplished by Steps 4-6)

**Infrastructure Enhancement Items**:
- [x] Create user documentation for first-time deployment setup (project-specific information requirements) - Issue #32
- [x] Create PATCH_RELEASE workflow - Added `patch sesame` trigger pointing to RELEASE_PROCESS in patch mode
- [x] Fix TEMPLATE_SYNCHRONIZATION workflow - KEYWORD_REGISTRY.md contamination - Updated Step 3 to clarify all project hook files need genericization
  - Template contains claude-swift specific content instead of placeholders
  - Should follow pattern of other hook files with `[EPIC_NAME]` placeholders
  - Found during spl1 migration (2025-07-06)


**Key Discovery**: claude-swift already implements battle-tested sidecar deployment pattern with dual-folder architecture.

**Critical Insight**: All files in /claude/project/ root are mandatory hooks - template correctly preserves only audit/ and todo.md structure.
