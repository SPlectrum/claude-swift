# Repository Todo List

## Version Transition to v1.1.0 (2025-06-26)

**VERSION_TRANSITION Workflow Steps**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] 1. Audit Log Analysis and Processing - Analyzed 304 audit entries, created dual reports
- [x] 2. Knowledge Base Synchronization - Updated architecture documentation with v1.0.0 insights
- [x] 3. Repository Maintenance and Cleanup - Fixed broken references, synchronized template system
- [x] 4. Strategic Analysis and Operational Reporting - Created comprehensive strategic analysis with v1.1.0 recommendations
- [x] 5. User-Facing Reports and Knowledge Base Updates - Built knowledge base with collaboration patterns, best practices, workflow effectiveness
- [x] 6. Get Started Documentation - Created practical onboarding guides based on real deployment experience
- [x] **Note**: Step 7 removed as redundant (objectives accomplished by Steps 4-6)

**v1.1.0 Strategic Priorities** (Based on v1.0.0 Analysis):
- [ ] **Documentation Automation** (40% effort reduction target) - Automate link validation, reference generation, template compliance
- [ ] **Interactive Development Expansion** (100% success pattern) - Apply InfoMetis validation approach to all features
- [ ] **Workflow Router Enhancement** - Create DOCUMENTATION, QUALITY, and AUTOMATION routers
- [ ] **Quality Gate Automation** - Convert manual compliance checking to automated validation
- [ ] **Architecture-First Standardization** (64% efficiency proven) - Make breakthrough pattern default approach

**Infrastructure Enhancement Items**:
- [ ] Check correctness of claude-swift documentation against actual implementation
- [ ] Create instructions for populating project directories after deployment
- [ ] Create TEMPLATE_PUBLISH workflow
- [ ] Design and implement FIX_RELEASE workflow for v1.0.x maintenance

**Key Discovery**: claude-swift already implements battle-tested sidecar deployment pattern with dual-folder architecture.

**Critical Insight**: All files in /claude/project/ root are mandatory hooks - template correctly preserves only audit/ and todo.md structure.
